Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs): 
We use a proprietary advertising serving system to display ads on our
site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third party
advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web site, and in these
instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our
site.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's
server about the online movements of Web users. For instance,
advertisers may place  a clear gif allowing them to recognize an
existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main
difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are
invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence.  Please keep in mind we do not
have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor
additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser. Please click here to see 
a list of these advertising agencies and their privacy policies.

The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration. The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12; within this section, the Ask  a Reporter page, and the Student Letters page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a "letter to the editor," providing their first name, grade, school and state/country and optionally their e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties. Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we’re concerned about a Parent’s right to consent to the collection and use of their child’s personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade, and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this information  (non-personally identifiable) or to  review or remove the optional e-mail address (personal information collected), please use this form to contact the Learning Network.




These Childrens’ guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of children’s  personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children’s personal information previously collected.
