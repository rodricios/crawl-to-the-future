<P><B>Cookies</B>: 
The New York Times on the Web employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on The New York Times on the Web, as well as to track site usage.

<p>
We use a proprietary advertising server to display ads on our site.  In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web site.  Please <a href="/web/20050723074625/http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/privacyinformation2.html">click here</a> to see a list of these advertising agencies and their privacy policies.

<p>
The New York Times on the Web is currently using and has contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our Web site in order to constantly improve the Web site quality. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of The New York Times on the Web is owned and used by The New York Times on the Web. The New York Times on the Web reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.

<p>
<B>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</B>: 
We use a proprietary advertising serving system to display ads on our
site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third party
advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web site, and in these
instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our
site.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's
server about the online movements of Web users. For instance,
advertisers may place  a clear gif allowing them to recognize an
existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main
difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are
invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence.  Please keep in mind we do not
have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor
additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser. Please <a href="/web/20050723074625/http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/privacyinformation2.html">click here</a> to see

These Childrens’ guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of children’s  personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children’s personal information previously collected.
