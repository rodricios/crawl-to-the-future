Mr Kaiser has been credited with turning around the fortunes of the national venue, in Covent Garden, central London, which is home to both the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet.





He was appointed in November 1998 from the American Ballet Theatre, and at the time was the opera house's fourth chief executive in two years.



Last year he presided over its re-opening after a �4m refurbishment.






Mr Kaiser said he was "proud" to have been part of the team which had completed work on the new opera house.





The opera house was desperately short of funds and had frequently been accused of snobbery, elitism and mismanagement.



There was uproar when �.5m of lottery funds had been donated to help fund the development, which itself suffered from years of rows and delays.







Now the new venue aims to attract a wider audience with cheaper ticket prices, and includes new studio theatres and bars and restaurants which are open all day.





"I believe we have laid the foundation for a remarkable and versatile arts organisation," Mr Kaiser said.





Chairman Sir Colin Southgate praised Mr Kaiser's "countless achievements".





"He has approached this enormously challenging job with unrelenting energy, commitment and determination.





"The Royal Opera House is now on a very sure footing both financially and artistically and we owe him a huge debt of gratitude."
