One was a cousin of Arbi
Barayev, a well-known rebel commander, he added.


Mr Udugov said that, before setting off on her mission, 22-year old Khala Barayeva had said: "I am going willingly to my death in the name of Allah and 
the freedom of the Chechen people."



Mr Udugov initially said 17 Russians had been killed in the
attack, but later revised the figure upwards to 27. 



He also
denied that any gun battle had taken place after the blast.



In a separate development, Russia's Foreign Ministry has denounced a visit to the United
States by Ilyas Akhmadov, foreign minister in Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's
government.



The ministry said it had delivered "the most decisive
protest" to the US Embassy over the visit, which it said
"contradicts the spirit of Russian-American relations".


Mr Akhmadov unveiled a plan for peace talks at a news conference in Washington on Monday.



Last weekend, US President Bill Clinton repeated Western calls for an end to the fighting in Chechnya and the start of
peace talks during a summit meeting in Moscow with President Vladimir Putin.

Moscow says it wants a political settlement in the region
but refuses to hold talks with President Maskhadov, whom it says should
stand trial for declaring Chechen independence.
