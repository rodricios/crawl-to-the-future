The white clothing is associated with the festival's undertone of purity, moral behaviour and sexual abstinence.

A sketch of the attacker has been issued from a description given by the victim.

The assailant was said to be between 20 and 25 years old, and of a strong, solid build.

Police said the description closely matched that of a man listed in police records, and who has already served time in jail for rape.

"We have 50 officers out in every corner of the island trying to locate the man," Chalit Thinthanee, Superintendent of Phuket Town Police Station, told the Gazette.


The victim was on holiday with her boyfriend and had walked into town on her own to
watch a fire-walking ceremony at a local shrine as part of the Vegetarian Festival.


Her boyfriend stayed in their hotel because he was ill.

The Gazette reported that the victim became lost on her way back to the hotel and was offered help by a Thai man on a motorbike.
