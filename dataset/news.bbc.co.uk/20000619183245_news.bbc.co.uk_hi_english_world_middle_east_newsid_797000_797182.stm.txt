The Lebanese President, Emile Lahoud, has said Israel must leave areas it still occupies in southern Lebanon before United Nations peacekeepers can be deployed there. 

His statement came after talks with the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who went to  Beirut to try to defuse the dispute over the withdrawal of Israeli troops last month. 

Mr Annan said after the meeting that the UN would take firm action against any violations of the border.

He said he expected 1,000 extra troops to join the UN peacekeeping force there next month.

On Sunday, the UN Security Council finally approved Mr Annan's verification that Israel's withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon is complete.

But Lebanon is disputing Mr Annan's report to the council, claiming Israel still occupies a number of border areas.

Fragile peace

Mr Annan has urged both Israel and Lebanon to respect the line the UN has laid out.

He says the priority is to get peacekeepers deployed as soon as possible to shore up the fragile peace. 

As the secretary-general arrived in Lebanon, UN peacekeepers and Lebanese military officers were checking alleged Israeli violations of the border. 

Lebanon says the areas Israel continues to occupy range from a few metres on the wrong side of the border fence to most of a front-line village.

Government forces

After two days of deliberation, the Security Council on Sunday endorsed Mr Annan's conclusion that Israel had ended its 22-year occupation in "full compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 425".
But it added that "it notes with serious concern reports of violations that have occurred since June 16, 2000".

Despite the disagreement, Lebanese Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss has said Lebanon will co-operate with the world body.

Mr Annan was also expected to urge the Lebanese Government to send its forces into the formerly occupied zone, which has been largely calm since Israel pulled its troops out at the end of May.

UN inspection teams have spent much of the time since then trying to verify if Israel has withdrawn to international boundaries.
