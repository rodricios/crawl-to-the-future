"In any case I think it is very difficult these days to just go out and draw a game.



"If you go back 15 to 20 years then the Italians were past masters at doing

"The rules as they stand now make it more difficult just to go out to draw a game and close it down."




Tony Adams is the only slight injury doubt as he is still recovering from a back strain, though Steve McManaman is fit again but will not start the match.



Keegan is expected to name the same side that started against Germany, with Dennis Wise keeping McManaman on the bench. 




Romania's legendary playmaker Gheorghe Hagi is out of the game after collecting two bookings and he may never play for the national side again.



He has confirmed that he will retire from international football when Romania are eliminated and only a victory gives him any hope of playing in the quarter-finals.



Romania are yet to name a replacement for Hagi.






The mood in the Romania camp is said to be determined, but  sweeper Gheorghe Popescu has admitted his team-mates are still 
devastated by the last-gasp defeat by Portugal on Saturday.
