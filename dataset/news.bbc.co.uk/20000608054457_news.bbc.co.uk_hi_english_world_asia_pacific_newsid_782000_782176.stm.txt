Rescue operations in Sumatra are continuing, amid growing criticism of the slowness of Indonesia's own response. 



The parliamentary speaker, Amien Rais, who has been touring the affected area, said he was ashamed that foreign governments and aid agencies had reacted much more promptly than his own government. 



Soon after the latest tremor, about 100 homeless people were reported to have blocked a key road to protest at the slow government response. About 30 police struggled to defuse tensions.



Hospital officials and local media say around 120 people were killed and some 1,300 injured in Sunday's quake, one of the biggest to hit Indonesia in recent years.





Thousands of homes and other buildings were destroyed. 



Foreign aid has been arriving in the region, but relief efforts have been hampered by heavy rains and flooding.


Earthquakes have recently rocked other parts of the region.



Japan had three fairly strong earthquakes this week and China and Myanmar each had two.


On Wednesday, a tremor measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale struck central Japan while on Thursday, a quake measuring 6.3 hit the areas bordering Myanmar and China.




Experts have said that the series of quakes could have sprung from Sunday's earthquake in Bengkulu causing a shift in the large tectonic plates in Asia's seas.
