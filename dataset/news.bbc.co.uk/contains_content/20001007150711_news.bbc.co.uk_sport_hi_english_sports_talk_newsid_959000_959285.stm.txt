The long-awaited World Cup qualifier between England and Germany is finally upon us.



Ever since the draw for the 2002 World Cup was made last year English and German fans have been eagerly anticipating the clash between two of the world's fiercest football rivals.



England have not beaten Germany in a World Cup match since the famous victory at the 1966 final and many feel that it is about time the nation put 34 years of hurt behind them.



But does Kevin Keegan's new 'look side' have the class to beat the German opposition?



And who do you think will star in Saturday's showpiece? Will David Beckham prove too much for Christian Ziege or will German striker Oliver Bierhoff cut England's defence down to size?



And what about England's strikeforce - can the Andy Cole and Michael Owen partnership work or will the fans be shouting for Alan Shearer's return?



England can win today , but its a question of confidence, not English confidence but German confidence. They have hit a long winning streak, they just don't accept the possibility of losing to England. Today we can win because we are stronger than ever before.

I'm afraid that with the inclusion of Gareth Southgate in mid-field is not a positive move. I find it difficult to see the merits of including him at all, let alone in a midfield role. I'm also concerned at the inclusion of Graham Le Saux, I would much rather have seen Gareth Barry playing in that position. I feel that Germany, especially with Bierhoff back in the starting line up are going to pose more of a threat going forward if only because Keegan seems to want to defend. also this is not the same team we faced 4 months ago, Janker and Bierhoff will be a massive threat. 1-1 is the most realistic scoreline and perhaps ia ma being hopeful.

The Germans are not as good as they were before, but they will win!!

Germany to win 1-0. I think the Germans will want to spoil the "last international at Wembley" party.

I hope England lose this match. The levels of Jingoism and xenophobia that arise on these occasions are quite disturbing. Surely the English people should grow up; this is sport not war.

I think it will be a draw. Even though
we may have some good goal scorers its pointless with the shape of England's defence because we just give-away our lead straightaway.

Alexander Monfreud,
England


German teams have always been known for their discipline and strength in defence, but they don't have the depth they had at Italia 90 or Euro 96. The German hoodoo is gone and England should win by a couple. A 3-1 win for Keagan's men.

Germans may not seem as strong as they used to be. But they've always had the capacity to compete. This game will be the return of Germans under Voller's leadership.

It's always a tough match against Germany, The only truly poor results (i.e. competitive matches)they have had lately are against Turkey and Portugal, who turned out to be the surprises of the 2000 tournament. So I wish all the best to England, and hope they play their top game on Saturday. If the lads are lifted by the Atmosphere they should win.

It's going to be an amazing, electric atmosphere at Wembley. The England fans will give a massive boot to the home side. I see Beckham and Scoles playing their part in a 2-0 England win.





England has a better squad and better players. Eventually they will click. They must do. I refuse to believe that they'll always play badly. Of course, the best way for this to happen is stability. Figo said that Portugal play so well because the team has been the same for years, that they all know each other well. I don't expect tomorrow to be a revelation as far as England are concerned, but i would like to see progress made over the qualifying campaign... And Germany... well they're always a threat, can always win, let's just hope we play well enough to win.

England is going to win aren't they? I predict a sending off and five injuries and maybe even a streaker. I don't agree that Andy Cole should be in the starting line-up and I think that Keegan should have brought Sheringham back into the squad, with the kind of form he's been showing lately he would've been a valuable asset to England.

The Germans will snatch the win. We are more technically gifted and far stronger. England's team is full of too many individuals who are unable to operate as a team unit.

Gavin Penney,
Germany

The Germans aren't as strong as they once were, and with the quality of players in the England squad we should win this one. I predict a 2-1 win for England

Cliff,

England for sure! It's time for records this year, first the windies after 31 years, now Germany after a long 34!

England will win a tight game when Joe Cole comes off the bench and creates a late winner for Michael Owen.

There is no way England will lose the last game at Wembley, even though the Germans have been in form of late. If we continue the pass and move style of play we employed so well against the French then England should come out comfortable winners. Midfield will be the key area but with the pace of Owen and Cole up front England will always pose a serious threat and should win the game 2-0. So let's get behind the team and give Wembley an appropriate send off!

It will probably be a draw, as that would suit the German side. Although this is the last game at the Twin Towers, and one would expect a lot of passion, I think the game is too crucial for both sides and hence we will not see too many risks being taken. Yes, this isn't a German side to fear, but neither is the English one. I predict 1-1.

Rob,
UK/USA

It will be a very tough game for both sides. Either could win, as they will put everything they have in it. The German team I feel is better prepared for this type of game. Germany will win as the English players are under too much pressure.

England has been beaten so badly so many times by Germany, that even one victory against Germany can make them believe that they are the best in the world. But seriously, what does England have apart from Scholes and Beckham? One victory against a weak German side means nothing. The Germans are playing aggressively again, so the time has come for the English people to romance about the victory in the World Cup. It is not going to happen again for another 34 years. Germany will win 2-0.

England will produce a performance equivalent to the one against Holland during Euro 96, and I predict the same score of 4-0 or 4-1 to England.

It has been 34 years since England defeated Germany! Is a psychological factor the deciding factor in the performance of players and the outcome of crucial matches? If so, then the German side stands a better chance especially when they are taking the battle right in the heart of the English people. Cameroon did just that to Nigeria early this year in Lagos. Again it was the psychological factor which gave Cameroon the Sydney 2000 Olympic Gold in soccer.

England must win the midfield sector and put the Germans under pressure. Keegan's side should close down the German's as quickly as possible when they get hold of the ball. Owen and Cole's pace should be too much for the slow German defence to handle. 

Ray Abdilla,

I think the whole occasion of it being the last game at Wembley will lift the players to collect all three points, if we can add to the positive performance of the first half in Paris we should beat an average German side around 2-0.

I think that the two styles of play will clash due to both managers playing with caution and the result will be a stalemate however there will be decent opportunities for both teams to snatch victory

I reckon that Germany is going to get the beating of a lifetime. It's the weakest Germany in years and I can't see England losing there last game at Wembley.

Craig Creed,

Hopefully Germany so we don't have to listen to the overbearing English biased press once again!

Ross,

I think Germany will win.  What I have seen of England in the past is no flare.  Where are the Bob Charltons?  They should be proud to pull on an English shirt.
