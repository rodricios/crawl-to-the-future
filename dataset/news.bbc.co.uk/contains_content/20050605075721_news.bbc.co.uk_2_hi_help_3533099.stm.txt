The BBC News desktop alert and breaking news e-mail services let you find out about all the latest news as it happens.

If you are outside the UK


If you are in the UK, you can also choose to be reminded about the best of our current affairs programming on BBC TV and Radio. 



These alerts will tell you about programmes coming up, and remind you when they are about to be broadcast. 



If you live outside the UK you can also find out about programming on BBC World Service.



The download is quick and simple and does not require any personal information from you.  Once installed, an alert box will appear on your PC whenever an important story breaks - just like the one at the top of this page. The box will include a link to give you swift access to the BBC News website. 



Breaking news alerts are also available via e-mail.
