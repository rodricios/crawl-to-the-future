			Six people have been killed in southern Afghanistan, in two attacks officials have blamed on Taleban fighters.

Early on Saturday gunmen stormed government offices in Helmand province, killing at least three policemen and injuring four others.

Earlier, three lorry drivers - two Afghans and a Pakistani - were shot dead when their military convoy was ambushed close to the Pakistani border.

Officials say the Taleban have carried out a number of recent attacks.


In Saturday's incident dozens of gunmen entered the district office in the town of Deshu, in Helmand province, and opened fire.

A local official said the attackers may have suffered casualties, but  took their dead or wounded away.

The earlier attack, took place overnight on Friday near the Afghan border town of Spin Boldak.



	
		
			
				
			
The lorry drivers had been transporting US military jeeps to Kandahar, the main American base in southern Afghanistan.

The Taleban failed to disrupt last October's presidential election, which was won by President Hamid Karzai.

This fuelled hopes among US and Afghan officials that the insurgency was fading.

But there has been a series of attacks in recent days - including a car bomb that killed one person in the eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday.

This has prompted speculation that the Taleban are preparing a spring offensive.
