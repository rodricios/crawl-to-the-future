        Michael Owen has held talks with both Liverpool and Newcastle as he nears a return to England from Real Madrid.

Owen held his first meeting with Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez since leaving Anfield on Monday, before seeing a Newcastle delegation.

The 25-year-old wants to join Liverpool but they only want to pay a similar fee to the £8m received for him last year.

Newcastle have already agreed a £17m fee with Real, but a return to Anfield seems more likely in the next 24 hours.


Liverpool, the defending European champions, would offer Owen Champions League football in a World Cup season.

Newcastle are second-from-bottom of the Premiership and have yet to score a goal in four games.

Owen met Benitez for two-and-a-half hours on Monday, after being left out of the Real side for their Primera Liga win at Cadiz on Sunday.

But the negotiatons are complicated by the Reds' reluctance to pay anything like the fee agreed by Newcastle.

The 25-year-old striker spent several hours with a delegation including Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd, manager Graeme Souness and captain Alan Shearer.

Owen has said he would play for the Magpies only on a one-year loan deal, although the club are trying to persuade him of the merits of a permanent move before Wednesday's transfer deadline.

Shearer told BBC Five Live he has spent "a fortune in phone calls to Madrid" trying to sway his former England strike partner into choosing Newcastle.

"We have three days left to try to convince him to come here. We're still in there fighting for him," he said.

Shearer told Owen that the hero status he would enjoy with Newcastle fans would make a permanent move to the north east worthwhile.

"I know if he came here he would be loved. They love their goalscorers up here and he would be a hero," he added.

"I know better than anyone what reception he would get here. I've had several phone conversations with him.

"But I don't have to tell him what passionate supporters we are. In the end he'll make his own mind up and will do what is best for himself."
