Forensic experts have been examining the house


Neighbours said mother Danielle Wails, 21, was attacked in her home in Cowgate by two men, who tied her up and set light to the building.



She was rescued after dialling 999 with her tongue and screaming through the letterbox, and is now in Newcastle General Hospital intensive care.



Her son Alexander Gallon was also taken to hospital, but later died.




Northumbria Police launched a murder inquiry and said they were appealing for people with information to come forward.



Neighbour Leanne Horspool, 15, said Ms Wails had been shouting for help through the letterbox until the fire brigade arrived and broke down the door.



"She stumbled out of the front door and was just all black and looked like she was covered in soot," said Ms Horspool.



"She told me she had managed to dial 999 with her tongue. She was shouting, 'My baby, my baby is in there'."



Chantelle Stoker, 12, said: "A wire was hanging down from one wrist and looked like it had been pulled tight with a knot in.



"She was saying that two men had got in, hit her and tied her up, then set the house alight.



"The firemen helped her out of the door and she just fell to the ground."



The property is understood to be run by a charity that houses single parents and pregnant women, and neighbours said Ms Wails had been there for five or six weeks.
