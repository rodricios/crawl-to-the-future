Parmar won 7-5 7-6 (7/3) as the Frenchman, who has won Â£4m in his career, found little answer to his opponent's big serve.

Pioline came into the event as the number one seed and was expected to proceed comfortably at the expense of Parmar, who was a wild card entry.

But Parmar, who has been based at the Nottingham Centre the past six years, showed how much is at home here and won in 90 minutes.

He proved last week how much he is improving by taking a set off Pete Sampras at the Stella Artois Championship before losing.
