The weapons were "enough to start a small war", according to one K-For official.



British Brigadier Richard Shirreff, who heads the British-led forces of K-For, said the stash had been opened within the last two weeks.




"They wouldn't have been digging it up if they weren't going to use it," he said.



He said the arms were "almost certainly entirely ethnic Albanian" and it was "inconceivable that the KPC knew nothing of the weapons cache".






Brigadier Shirreff said he would be discussing the arms find with the KLA. 



The KLA had agreed to disarm and transform itself into the KPC, a civilian disaster relief group, under the United Nations-brokered peace accord following Nato's bombing campaign against Serbia.
