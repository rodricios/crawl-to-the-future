The police chief in India's eastern state of Bihar has asked political parties to help put an end to the caste killings after the latest attack left 34 people dead.
He also said he did not have sufficient resources to deter crime.
In comments to BBC News Online,  KA Jacob said: "I would ask social organisations, and political organisations in particular, to instil a sense of trust among the various caste groups".

Mr Jacob said the various political parties should refrain from fanning caste violence by taking sides in the group clashes.

"A deterrent has to come from within the society itself."

Lawlessness


Thirty-four lower caste Hindus were killed on Friday by suspected members of a banned private army of landlords in the remote village of Miapur in Aurangabad district.

The residents of Miapur allege that the attack was in response to the killing of 12 landlords in Bihar's Nawada district on 10 June.

With an average of 5000 homicides and 12,000 other incidents of rioting and abduction, Bihar is considered India's most lawless state.
However, Mr Jacob insisted that did not paint a true picture of the state.

He said Bihar had 10% of India's population, while its crime figures were 6% of the national average.



"On that count, Bihar stands 22nd or 23rd on the criminality in the entire country," said Mr Jacob.


"But that does not mean I am absolving myself of the responsibility. 
Resources


"You have to consider that the national average of policemen per population is 136 for 100,000 citizens, while in Bihar the number is 85," the Bihar police chief said.

Bihar's police force stands currently at 87,000 and Mr Jacob said another 50,000 policeman would be required just to reach the national average.

While admitting that caste killing was a serious issue, he criticised the bureaucracy for stymieing efforts to control such killings.

"To go after the gangs, the marauders, we had recommended a taskforce of 15 groups of 40 men each.

"But nothing has come out of it in the last nine months, despite assurances," Mr Jacob said.

For three decades, Bihar has witnessed a seemingly endless cycle of tit-for-tat caste murders.

Extreme leftwing Maoist groups conscript poor farmers into their private armies which often clash with gangs hired by local landlords.
