The NCS will spearhead operations involving the police, Immigration Service, the
National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), Customs and the security
services.

There will also be increased co-operation with European colleagues, said NCS
director general Roy Penrose, who visited Europol officials at their
headquarters in The Hague on Friday.

'Tragic incident'

"The tragic incident at Dover further concentrates all our minds on the
danger and misery caused by those who traffic in people for profit," he said.

"Behind these events are some very evil and ruthless people, who often
smuggle other commodities too, including drugs, and are actively involved in
international organised crime.

"Our two sets of operational plans are aimed at taking the initiative away
from them, bringing together all the good work already done by all the law
enforcement and intelligence agencies."

The move followed the discovery at Dover on Monday of 58 bodies in a Dutch-registered lorry. It is believed the victims were of Chinese origin.

Ruthless trade

Smuggling people into the UK is a multi-million pound business.

It is believed many illegal immigrants from China are used as slave labour in restaurants in London.
