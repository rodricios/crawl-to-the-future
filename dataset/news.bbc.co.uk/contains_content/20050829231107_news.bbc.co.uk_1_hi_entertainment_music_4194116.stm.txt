			Green Day won seven awards, out of eight nominations, at the MTV music awards in Miami on Sunday.

"It's great to know that rock music still has a place at MTV," said Green Day lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong.

The awards went ahead despite concerns over Hurricane Katrina, which hit Florida last week, and after a shooting at a pre-awards party.

Record boss Suge Knight was shot in the leg at a party for Kanye West and is expected to require surgery.


Green Day won awards for best rock video and best video for Boulevard of Broken Dreams, as well as best group, the viewers' choice award and several technical awards.

Dominated

Their only nomination which did not yield a prize was art direction, which went to Gwen Stefani for What You Waiting For?

Rock music dominated the awards after several years of pre-eminence for hip hop. 

Kanye West was the only rapper to win an "all-genre" award, with his Jesus Walks taking best male video.

The Killers won the award for best new artist. 

But Pete Weintz of Fall Out Boy, who won the MTV2 award for best song,  downplayed cries of "rock is resurgent".

'Happen organically'

"Whatever is going to happen is going to happen organically. The return of rock doesn't mean anything else is going away."

 "The theme of tonight is, anything can happen," said host P Diddy, whose entrance included dancers, pyrotechnics and a cascading waterfall.

 Kelly Clarkson's Since U Been Gone won two awards, for best female and pop video.

Also winning two awards were Missy Elliott, Gwen Stefani and Damon Albarn's band Gorillaz, for best special effects in a video and breakthrough video .

On Sunday, Miami police said they had no suspects in the shooting of Knight, who was shot in the upper right leg on Saturday in a Miami nightclub.

"We are interviewing all the witnesses we can to hopefully develop a composite," Miami Beach police spokesman Bobby Hernandez said.
