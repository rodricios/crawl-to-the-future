Of all the occasions in the venue's footballing  history, there is no doubt which one ranks highest in his memory.




"Wembley has been famous for many great matches - European Cup finals, internationals,  but the most important game Wembley ever hosted was the World Cup final in 1966," he says.



"For Germany to be the last match before it's demolished gives it extra significance.



"I think it will be a tough game and I think we are ready for it.




"But I don't think of Wembley as an  England-Germany thing - more of it being a great place where great football matches were held."



The stadium holds many special memories for Sir Bobby.



"I thought it was magic - I travelled all over the world and I never played anywhere where I felt so comfortable and happy," he says.



"I used to feel Wembley was right - the right place to hold really big games and I've never changed my feelings about that.



"The players loved playing there - you walk onto the pitch and the ball runs smooth.



"I always remember the World Cup - many famous cup finals, great internationals, Barca winning the Champions League  final."



But time has taken its toll, and change became inevitable.



"t was a great place, great venue, but it's been overtaken by others," says Sir Bobby.



"When Wembley was built, there was nothing like it in the world.



"People around the world look on England as the home of football. They know the importance of Wembley - it has this affection. Time has passed it by."



He says architect Lord Foster brought gasps when he unveiled the ambitious plans for the new Wembley Stadium.



"I think the expectation around the world is it has to be better than anywhere else - and I think it will be," he says.
