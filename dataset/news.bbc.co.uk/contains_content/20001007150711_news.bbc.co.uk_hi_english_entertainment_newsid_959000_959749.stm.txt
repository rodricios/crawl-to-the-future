To them, it is as if a British director decided to do a remake of American director Martin Scorsese's 1973 gritty urban crime drama 
Mean Streets. 

Stallone is eager to set the record straight. He maintains his 
Get Carter is more a launching pad for a very different story than just a line-by-line remake. 

"The (1971) film totally remains intact. I thought it would be an error  to try to go note-for-note or follow that path," he says. 

Sir Michael appears opposite Stallone in a small cameo in several scenes in the new Get Carter. 

Stallone recalls it felt a little strange on the set standing opposite Sir Michael in a role the respected British actor made his own 30 years ago.

"It's like being a burglar. I'm robbing your house right in front of you, 
and being the sportsman that he is, he was just so overwhelmingly supportive," he says.

The original Get Carter delivered a raw, sordid look inside Newcastle's underworld. It was a sexually charged work displaying some memorable cinematic artistry.

 It had a stellar cast that showcased the talents, not only of  
 Sir Michael, but also Britt Ekland and Ian Hendry.
