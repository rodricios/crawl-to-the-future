But Cuban-American members of Congress opposed to Mr Castro have introduced restrictions in the legislation, limiting the scope of any sales by preventing financing by the US Government or American banks. 
"What I have been told is that it looks like it eases  the embargo on food and medicine, but it probably doesn't very much,  because it doesn't provide any financing credits," said Mr  Clinton.


The bill also tightens and incorporates into law existing US travel restrictions to Cuba  - a move which Mr Clinton said was an unwarranted intrusion on the president's right to conduct foreign policy. 





Both Houses of Congress are due to take a final vote on the legislation, which is part of a $75bn agricultural funding bill,  in the next week or so.







'Bill is passable'


The proposal has been sharply criticised by the Cuban Government which says it could actually strengthen the embargo because of the severe restrictions on travel and trade it contains.

 
It would also prevent the US Government or American banks from financing any food sales to Cuba.

But Republican Bill Young, who is also the House Appropriations Committee chairman, said:  "We think the bill we've written is passable and should be signable."
