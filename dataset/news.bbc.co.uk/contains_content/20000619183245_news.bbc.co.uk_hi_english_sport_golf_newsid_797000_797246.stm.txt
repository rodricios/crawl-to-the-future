Woods himself claimed it was his greatest victory.



"All week I had a sense of calmness I haven't had for a while," said the
world number one, a winner now 26 times in his 100 starts since leaving the
amateur ranks and also a winner of over $19m in his career.



His victory may have been the greatest in championship history, but it is certain not to his last.



He now has his sights on The Open.



Nicklaus is the youngest player to complete a Grand Slam at 26, but Woods will break yet more new ground if he takes the St Andrews title.



Bookmakers William Hill price him the 7/4 favourite to win at St Andrews - the shortest odds ever for a pre-tournament Open favourite, another record!



And with his astonishing form there will not be many betting against Woods completing the Grand Slam next month.
