He said it called into question who was in charge in the West Bank.

An Israeli army statement said earlier that responsibility for guarding the tomb had been handed over to the Palestinian authorities because both sides wanted to defuse tension. 

 The 12 border guards were pulled out helicopter early on Friday. The army said one of its soldiers was shot and wounded during the withdrawal.

Palestinian triumph

Palestinian police later forced the demonstraters to leave, but the Palestians were still jubilant over the Israeli departure.

"We consider this a big victory," said Ali Farraj, a local Palestinian leader."It cost us a lot of blood and we feel proud of this victory".

"It's like getting rid of a bone stuck in your throat," said a Palestinian security officer.
