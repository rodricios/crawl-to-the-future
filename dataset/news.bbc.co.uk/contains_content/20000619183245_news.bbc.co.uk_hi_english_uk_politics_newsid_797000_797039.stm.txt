The Tory MP accused the home secretary of using "spin" to hide the part of three Labour MPs in opposing the bill and added he only dropped the proposals after being told that the complicated measure "was more important for the government to do".

Defending Labour's policies, the home secretary said that little would have been achieved by the implementation of the proposed law.

This was because, he said, the intelligence services had suspected almost none of the hundreds of England fans arrested in the Netherlands and Belgian of being likely to cause trouble. 

Alcohol ban

Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes said: "The best way forward is to concentrate not on what might have been, but what we can do now."

He called for the Belgian authorities to introduce alcohol bans around the areas likely to be affected by thuggery and also called for more police 'spotters' to work among fans to discover any plans they may have to cause mayhem.

While Labour backbencher Joe Ashton warned the House that unless England fans behaved, Uefa would have no hesitation in banning England from playing in the rest of the tournament.

He also told MPs that England's bid to hold the 2006 World Cup was also at stake.

"German fans will try and get England fans into a riot situation to get them thrown out." 

He added: "We could lose the World Cup because a handful of yobbos thew some pint glasses."
