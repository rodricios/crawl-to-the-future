A small private plane has crashed into an office building in Austin, Texas. 

The Austin fire department said that most employees have been evacuated, but one person was currently unaccounted for. 

An eyewitness who was working next door said his "entire building shook". 

The building is next door to FBI field offices, but the bureau said there was no indication the crash was deliberate.
