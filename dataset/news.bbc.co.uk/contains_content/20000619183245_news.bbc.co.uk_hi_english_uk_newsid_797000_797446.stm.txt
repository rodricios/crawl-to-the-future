A man monitoring crowd flow into the Hillsborough ground on the day of the disaster has told a court he heard a message on a police radio saying that if a gate outside the stadium was not opened someone would be killed.

Roger Houldsworth told Leeds Crown Court that the reply he heard was "open the gate".

Two former senior police officers are accused of manslaughter at Sheffield Wednesday's ground where 96 football fans were crushed to death at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

The prosecution allege that the crush occurred after Exit Gate C was opened to relieve pressure on the turnstiles, causing hundreds of people to flood into the stands.
'Abnormal build-up'

Mr Houldsworth, who developed a computer system for Sheffield Wednesday to count fans into the ground, was working in the club's control box.

He said the message he heard was: "If we do not open a gate someone is going to die."

Within seconds the reply came back on the radio saying: "If someone's going to die, open the gate, open the gate," Mr Houldsworth said.

He told the jury he could see on the monitors "an abnormal build-up" outside the ground.

"Gate C was opened and the crowd surged through," he said.

During cross-examination by William Clegg, QC, for Mr Duckenfield, Mr Houldsworth said that on the police radio it did not specify which gate should be
opened.

South Yorkshire Police's match commander on the day - former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, and his assistant, former Superintendent Bernard Murray, have pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter of two victims.


Mr Duckenfield, 55, of Bournemouth, Dorset, and Mr Murray, 58, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, also deny wilfully neglecting to carry out a public duty.


'Police pushed fans'

Adrian Brazener, a sergeant with Nottinghamshire Police, told the court he was helping police at the Forest End when he noticed problems at the other side of the ground.

"It appeared to be a pitch invasion," he said.

"Only when I got to the penalty area I realised it was more serious. I could see something was amiss.

"People were on the fencing pushing people back down to the pens.

"Then I could see officers pushing people off the fences, on the floor, onto people struggling to get back up."

Sgt Brazener told the jury that he had attended a police briefing on the morning of the match which was held by Mr Duckenfield.

He told the court that someone at the briefing told officers working in the Leppings Lane End to take a meal break at 2.45pm.

Sgt Brazener said he thought it was unusual for a break to be taken so close to kick-off.
