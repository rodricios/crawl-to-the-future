Rafik Hariri's widow was among the first to vote


Beirut voters took part in the first poll to be held for more than 30 years without Syrian troops in the country.



People in the rest of Lebanon will cast ballots over the next three Sundays.



The anti-Syrian opposition in the capital is led by Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri.




Syrian troops withdrew last month, following a wave of opposition protests blaming Damascus for the killing in February. Syria denies any involvement.



Even before voting began, nine out of 12 Beirut seats had gone unchallenged to the Martyr Rafik Hariri list. 



The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says turnout appears to have been low - especially in Christian parts of town where some regarded the vote as a foregone conclusion. 



Polling to choose 128 MPs will take place over the coming weeks, with seats allocated to equal numbers of Christians and Muslims.


Anti-Syrian factions were expected to do well


Next Sunday the voting will shift to the south of the country.



The two main Shia groups, Hezbollah and Amal, have formed the Resistance, Liberation and Development list, and are expected to win  most of the seats there.



Our correspondent says the main competition is likely to be within the Maronite Christian camp.



Leading Christian opposition figure Michel Aoun - who has many supporters in the north - is heading his own election list after failing to agree on a broad opposition alliance. 



The election has been light on issues and heavy on horse-trading between the factions that have dominated the country's politics for decades, our correspondent says.



But the election will consolidate a new political reality largely free from Syrian interference, he says.
