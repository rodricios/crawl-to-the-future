 
I wish to thank all those who showed their trust in me and voted for me at these elections, and also to thank all those who did not vote for me, since they have relieved my soul of a great burden of responsibility, which I have been carrying for 10 full years. 


As regards my party, it will be a very strong opposition, and I have always said that a party cannot always show all its strength and all its qualities if it is not in the opposition for some time, since the time spent in opposition enables it to get rid of the burden of those who, out of greed, entered the party while it was a ruling party. 


I am certain that these upcoming times will be of great benefit in this respect, both for the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] and the Yugoslav Left [JUL], and I am certain that this will strengthen [the parties] to such an extent that they will very convincingly win the next elections.

I personally - precisely because of this great relief, because of the end of this great responsibility that I have been carrying for a whole decade - intend to take a short break, to spend more time with my family, especially with my grandson Marko, and then, afterwards, to primarily strengthen my party, so that it - in the social life of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - as well as the forces that are with it, contributes greatly to the further development of the country... 


I congratulate Mr Kostunica on his election victory and wish all citizens of Yugoslavia much success in the coming mandate of the new president. Thank you.
