A sliding roof is to be constructed, which could cover the fans but not the pitch.



This will be left open between events but can be moved to line up with the touchline within 15 minutes, giving shelter to spectators.



Fans will still be able to walk down Wembley's famous Olympic Way, which is earmarked for an upgrade, and the new stadium is being slightly repositioned so it directly faces the approach.



Once inside, escalators are to replace the daunting steps which have tested supporters down the years.



There will be more leg room when you sit down, with a promise of 30 per cent more space around each seat. 


And obstructed views should be a thing of the past, with no pillars and steeper terracing helping to provide a clearer view of the action.



Of course, not all changes will be considered for the better.



Those with fond memories of their sides proudly walking out onto the pitch alongside their opponents could be in for a shock.



Teams are likely to arrive from opposite ends of the stadium and meet in the centre circle.



But some things will never change, even at the new Wembley.



A Royal Box is to be built into the stadium so the tradition of teams climbing the steps to collect trophies will continue.



And getting hold of tickets in the first place is likely to be just as difficult, although the prices will only have increased in line with inflation.
