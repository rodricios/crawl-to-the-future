The system enables high-speed data including television channels to be transmitted over existing networks, bypassing the need for PCs, modems, satellite dishes or digital decoders.

Big companies, including Sony and Ericsson, are said to be interested in the technology.
Government plan
Local resident Simon Hopkins already gets digital TV, internet, e-mail, shopping services and information on what's new locally.  He said: "It's good. We never had Sky (satellite) before so it is a new experience for us all."

Eventually, school children will be able to access their homework through the local network, while homeowners will be able to check information such as the progress of planning applications.

Council leader Pat Doyle said: "The dream is for everybody in the city to have access, not only to the internet but into programmes which we, as a city council, and all the other agencies provide.

"If we do that, then we have taken this council and all councils light years down the track which the government wants us to pursue."

Kingston Communications is now seeking to get access to the telephone exchanges operated by British Telecom, so the city can launch a low-cost, high-speed internet service.
