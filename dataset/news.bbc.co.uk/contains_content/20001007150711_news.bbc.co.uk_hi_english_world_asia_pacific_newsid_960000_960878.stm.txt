The clashes began on Friday after police moved in to tear  down separatist flags.




Residents  said the security forces shot dead two pro-independence supporters in the ensuing confrontation and that  enraged locals then turned on migrants living in the area.



A spokesman for a local human rights group said that thousands of people had locked themselves into their homes to try to escape further bloodshed.





The spokesman, John Rumbiak, said about 1,000 students had staged a demonstration in the regional capital, Jayapura, on Saturday, calling for an end to the fighting.



However the provincial police chief, Brigadier General Sylvanus Wenas, said extra troops had been sent to Wamena, and that the situation there appeared calm.



He said that the security forces had driven out of town many of the activists and separatist rebels, who were armed with bows, arrows and machetes.
