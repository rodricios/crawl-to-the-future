Professor Plant told BBC News Online that she was very disappointed with the stance taken by Breakthrough Breast Cancer. 



"My book is very heavily based on science.



"I knew I would get this sort of attack, but nevertheless I thought that morally I had to put this knowledge in the public domain so that people could judge for themselves."


Professor Plant said there was a wealth of scientific evidence to suggest that dairy products were linked to cancer.



For instance, rates of breast and prostate cancer were much lower among women in the Far East until they started to adopt Western diets and eat dairy products for the first time.



In China, breast cancer is referred to as "rich woman's disease" because it afflicts the more affluent classes who tend to eat a westernised diet.



She said milk was known to contain growth factors that stimulate breast development in teenage girls, and chemicals that mimic the effects of the female sex hormone oestrogen - which has been strongly linked to breast cancer.
