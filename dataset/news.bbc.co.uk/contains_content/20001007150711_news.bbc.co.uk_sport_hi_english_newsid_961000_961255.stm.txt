Thousands of people were evacuated but no suspect package has been found.

An authenticated coded bomb warning was received at 1325 BST by staff at London's Charing Cross Hospital and was passed to police before the evacuation.

The BBC's Northern Ireland correspondent Denis Murray said the bomb scare was almost certainly the work of a dissident Irish republican group.

He said they appeared to be taking out of leaf out of the Provisional IRA, who were responsible for the Aintree scare in 1997.

Mr Murray said: "It gets them lots of publicity without the risk. It costs just 20p for a phonecall and they don't need to sacrifice volunteers."




I saw people walking out with bottles of champagne and they looked fairly
relaxed about it and there was no panic

Racegoers were led to safety from the grandstand and across the course itself within eight minutes, inside established practice times.

The alert happened at Ascot's last and biggest flat race meeting of the season as jockeys had been preparing for a five-furlong event, the second race of the afternoon.

Only one race had taken place at the meeting, which passed an inspection at 1230 BST following heavy rain.

The evacuation of the race-goers by security staff was without panic and people walked calmly and without hurry out of the stands.

Bookmaker William Tye said: "I saw people walking out with bottles of champagne and they looked fairly relaxed about it and there was no panic."

He said it could have been disastrous had the meeting been heavily attended.

"The horses had gone to post, everyone was betting on the race and all of a sudden we got the announcement over the tannoy to evacuate the grandstand.

"It all went calmly because it was a very small crowd. 

"What with the weather and the England football it was one of the smallest crowds I have seen.

"If it had been Royal Ascot with 30,000 or 40,000 people it would have been a different kettle of fish."

Presenters, camera crews and other staff on BBC Television's Grandstand programme were forced to vacate their studio facilities as part of the security precautions.

Police are carrying out a total search of the racecourse to make sure it is absolutely safe before staff are readmitted to the ground.

Officials at Ascot said that, assuming the course is given the all-clear, race-goers could return to the track between 1000 and 1500 BST on Sunday to collect any belongings left behind. 

Alternatively, they can contact the course on 01344 876 876.


The last major meeting to be the subject of a security alert was the King George VI Chase card at Kempton on 27 December when the card was abandoned after the big race.

'Desperately disappointed'

Events director David Demolder said: "We are desperately disappointed for all the racegoers, sponsors, owners, trainers and jockeys who braved the inclement weather to come here today and who have now been deprived of what should have been a great afternoon of racing."

"The operation to evacuate the racecourse, which was handled in close co-operation by the police and our own security staff, went very smoothly and I would like to thank everyone for their understanding."

Jockey Seb Sanders told Grandstand the targeting of a race meeting was "absolutely ridiculous".

"The only thing it's spoiling is fun for everybody. 

"What do you say about these people? They're a pain in the backside, really."

Refunds from bets on abandoned races should be available from either the Tote or bookmakers.
