The main opposition leader in Ivory Coast,  Alassane Ouattara, has appealed for calm after the Supreme Court disqualified him from contesting the forthcoming presidential election.


If the country has to burn, it will be General Guei who will be responsible for it

He said he was shocked and disappointed by the ruling which he described as "a masquerade"  orchestrated by the military leader, General Guei.

In its ruling on Friday, the Supreme Court cleared the candidacy of General Guei and four others, but rejected Mr Ouattara's because of questions over his nationality.

The electoral commission has announced that campaigning for the 22 October poll officially opens on Saturday, although a state of emergency imposed before the court ruling continues until Monday evening.
Nationality issue

However Mr Ouattara, while urging his followers to exercise restraint, hinted that violence remained a possibility.

"If the country has to burn, it will be General Guei who will be responsible for it, he told Associated Press on Saturday.

Mr Ouattara, a former prime minister, has repeatedly denied the authorities' claim that one of his parents was from Burkina Faso and  not a native Ivorian.

Judge Tia said in the court ruling that there were doubts over the identity and nationality of the opposition leader's mother.  

He added that Mr Ouattara could not say - as he had in documents that he submitted to the court to prove his eligibility - that he had never used another nationality.

The country's new constitution declares that the parents of all presidential candidates must be born in the country and must never have held another nationality.
Tensions

Ivory Coast has been tense in recent days.

The security forces have arrested hundreds of people without Ivorian identification documents from poorer neighbourhoods which tend to support Mr Ouattara.

And bus and taxi services have been crowded with immigrants trying to leave the country, appearing to fear an outbreak of violence.

The state of emergency, which gives the interior minister authority to restrict traffic and ban meetings, is accompanied by an overnight curfew.

'Arbitrary exclusions'

On Friday, a United States envoy, Nancy Powell, met General Guei in Abidjan and appealed for him to guarantee that the presidential election would be free and fair.

The US has been opposed to General Guei's candidacy. Former colonial power France has also warned that there should be no "arbitrary exclusions" from the race. 

There have been at least two military revolts since General Guei took power, further  shaking  the country's standing as a bastion of stability in troubled West Africa.
