Sri Lanka has appealed for calm after a suicide bomber killed a senior minister and 21 others.

The attack marred the country's first War Heroes' Day, aimed at boosting the morale of troops battling Tamil rebels in the north.

Dozens of people were wounded in the blast - including the minister's wife.

Curfews have been imposed in local areas and the government has warned against anyone instigating retaliatory attacks. 


A BBC correspondent says the attack has raised tension in Colombo and raised fears of a backlash against the minority Tamil community.

Suicide attack

The attack has been widely condemned both within Sri Lanka and by the international community.



Tiger targets










1991  Former Indian PM Rajiv Gandhi killed














1993 Sri Lankan President Premadasa killed














1994 Sri Lankan opposition leader Dissayanaka killed














1999 Sri Lankan President Kumaratunga wounded














2000  Industry Minister Gooneratne killed














At a special meeting of the British Parliament to discuss the Sri Lankan civil war, Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain described the bombing as "an atrocious act".

Police blamed Tamil Tiger separatists, who have frequently used  suicide bombers, for carrying out the attack.

There has been no reaction from the Tigers.

Four people are reported to have been taken in for questioning by police.

CV Gooneratne, Sri Lanka's industry minister, was assassinated as he was collecting donations for the army in his constituency in Colombo.

Eyewitnesses said a man walked up to the minister - who was surrounded by his supporters - and set off the bomb after embracing him.

The scene of the blast resembled a carnage, with body parts strewn all around.

Earlier in the day, Mr Gooneratne had attended a special meeting with President Chandrika Kumaratunga, held to commemorate soldiers battling the Tigers.
