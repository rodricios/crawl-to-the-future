Anyone caught trying to smuggle out "souvenirs" of the historic venue, such as pieces of turf or seats, will be arrested for theft, police have warned.

About 1,000 officers will also patrol the streets of London to prevent trouble between rival fans.

Police have said a small number of known German troublemakers are expected at the match, but will be closely monitored. About 7,500 German fans in total are due to attend the game.

Wembley officials also expect to eject 200 fans who have bought private hospitality tickets, even though many may have done so unwittingly and have paid up to �200.

Planning for the game has stretched back months and included the German police, the Football Association and the National Criminal Intelligence Service.

Commander David Smith, head of police operations at Wembley, said: "This is a remarkable historic occasion, which we want people everywhere in London to be able to celebrate in safety.

"We want all those coming to the match and those who will see it in pubs and clubs to be able to enjoy themselves in a safe and trouble free environment."
