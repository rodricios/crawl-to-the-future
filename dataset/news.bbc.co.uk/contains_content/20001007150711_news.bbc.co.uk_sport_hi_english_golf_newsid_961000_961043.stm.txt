Play has been suspended at a drenched Loch Lomond on Saturday with Europe in a commanding five-point lead on day two of the Solheim Cup.



Sophie Gustafson and Trish Johnson beat American pair Rosie Jones and Becky Iverson to give Europe a perfect start to the fourballs.



Their 3&2 fourball victory was soon followed by further European success when Alison Nicholas and Helen Alfredsson also completed a 3&2 win over Juli Inkster and Sherri Steinhauer.



Already leading by three points after the Friday's foursomes, Europe look set to enter the final day's singles in a strong position.



One up in two of the remaining four ties, Europe are all square in one and trailing by a single hole in the last tie.



Annika Sorenstam and Janice Moodie, Europe's top pairing, are one down to Pat Hurst and Kelly Robbins with six to play.



Play will resume at 0815 BST on Sunday, with the singles following immediately after the completion of the fourballs.
