She also asked for more details on when the lorry had been inspected before arriving at Dover.

Checks outside Britain were not as rigorous as they could be, she said. And lorry drivers were compulsorily separated from their vehicles during ferry crossings.

Security discussions

Mr Straw replied that last week he had been discussing in Lisbon co-operation with other EU interior ministers on cracking down on "asylum shopping".

Progress had been made on checking those boarding Eurostar trains, he said.

Discussions were going on with other authorities including hauliers, about improving port security.

Since the latest tragedy, he had had a meeting with P&O chairman Lord Sterling.

This year, the government has already introduced £2,000 fines for any lorry driver caught carrying stowaways.

International policing

Mr Straw said the driver penalties had already resulted in a 26% drop in illegal immigrants.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes said the traffickers in human life should be tracked "down to the ends of the earth" and punished as severely as possible. He also called for better international policing.

But the government had not answered how people wishing to seek asylum could do so lawfully. They were bound to use illegal methods, he said.

Mr Straw said co-operation within Europe was improving gradually.

"But we have some way to go before we have properly sensitised a number of other governments, particularly some of those in Asia, about the need for their full co-operation, in practice as well as in principle, with the steps they have to initiate to avoid this terrible traffic."
