And an East Sussex, Brighton and Hove Health Authority spokesman said tests had proved that the man, who died at the town's Royal Sussex County Hospital on May
15, had been infected by the bug.



So far two addicts in Liverpool and three from Manchester have died from clostridium poisoning, along with seven from other parts of England, 16 from Glasgow and eight from Dublin. 



In addition, three further deaths not included in the official figures are being linked to the illness by police in Wolverhampton.



The killer illness first emerged among heroin injectors in Glasgow last month.



It appears that addicts who inject heroin into muscle tissue, rather than their veins are at risk.



Dr Angela Iversen, East Sussex, Brighton and Hove Health Authority's consultant on communicable disease 
control, said: "The best advice we can give heroin users at the moment is to smoke the drug, if they are going to take it, rather than injecting it."



The specific bacterium responsible, Clostridium
novyi Type A is found in soil and animal droppings.
