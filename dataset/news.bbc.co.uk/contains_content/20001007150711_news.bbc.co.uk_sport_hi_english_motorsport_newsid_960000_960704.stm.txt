Hakkinen said: "I'm disappointed. The last run was pretty good but I wasn't able to accelerate as fast as I wanted to out of the last corner."



David Coulthard was the first of the drivers from the top teams to set a time, but he was slightly slower than the two title contenders and had to be content with third, ahead of Schumacher's team-mate, Rubens Barrichello.



Jenson Button was one of the stars of qualifying, putting his Williams-BMW fifth on his first visit to Suzuka, one of the world's toughest tracks, in a racing car.



He again outqualified his team-mate, Ralf Schumacher.



Button said: "I'm ecstatic. To come somewhere like Suzuka and qualify fifth is amazing. The first day I thought: 'Jeez, this is tough.' I was about 1.5sec off Ralf. But we worked very hard to get up here and it's great to be the first guy behind McLaren and Ferrari."



It was a good afternoon for the British drivers in Japan, with Jaguar drivers Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert also in the top 10, in seventh and 10th places respectively.



Irvine said the car suited the new tyres that tyre supplier Bridgestone had brought to the race and that Jaguar had found an advantage by taking a step back on some developments it had made to the car.



Controversially, tyre supplier Bridgestone has taken only one type of tyre to Japan, and it is of one of the harder types. 



This in theory plays into Ferrari's hands, as its F1-2000 car has proved to be harder on its rubber than McLaren's MP4-15, and the silver cars can run softer tyres, which provide more grip, more easily than Ferrari.



The decision flies in the face of Bridgestone's insistence at the beginning of this year that it wanted to make more difficult the teams' decision on which tyres to use over a Grand Prix weekend.



The tyre would have had little bearing on qualifying performance, as both teams had the same tyre, but it could remove one of McLaren's potential strong points in the race.
