This is admissible under US law when anti-trust cases are of national importance and deemed critical to the economy, according to anti-trust expert Bob Lande. 

Judge Jackson and one of the parties must make the request to bypass the appeals court.

The government has an interest in filing this  request because, in 1998, the appeals court handed down a ruling favourable to Microsoft. 

But the Supreme Court is not compelled to take the case, and John Coffee, with the Columbia School of Law, believes that a direct appeal to the United State's highest court would fail. 

"I think that the Supreme Court does not want to have to be the initial court of review in such a complicated case," he said.

He added that Supreme Court judges may look to the appeals court to focus the debate. 

Presidential politics

The timing of the next steps is important because this time next year, the US will have a new president, and whether that president is Democrat Al Gore or Republican George W Bush could have a major impact on the case.

If Al Gore wins, there would be little change in the government's prosecution of the case, but if Mr Bush is the victor, the course of the trial could change. 

George W Bush has said that in his view of anti-competition law only fixing prices should be illegal, Mr Lande said. 

If elected, Mr Bush would not make immediate changes to the Justice Department, but by the middle of 2001, key appointments would most likely be in place. 

However, even if Mr Bush were to completely remake the Justice Department into one much friendlier to Microsoft, the company would still have to contend with the 17 states in the case, Mr Lande said. 

"But it would be much weaker than a united front," he added.
