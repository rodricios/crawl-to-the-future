An eight-year-old girl needs plastic surgery after being savaged by a bull mastiff dog only days after that dog avoided being put down for an alleged similar attack.

Chelsea Troup, from Whitley Bay in Tyne and Wear, was playing in a paddling pool at Kaiser's owner's home when the dog attacked on Sunday afternoon. 

She is expected to undergo six hours of plastic surgery at the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary after wounds to her arms, thighs, buttocks and armpits.

"It was an horrific attack," said a Northumbria Police spokesman.

Dog under observation

Kaiser has been put in a secure kennel at North Shields police station and the owner, Carol McQueen, reported, under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

The police will seek leave from magistrates to have the dog destroyed.

Kaiser had been subject to a prosecution on Friday after an alleged similar attack in which a 14 year-old boy was left with 100 stitches.

The Prosecution Service dropped that case after witnesses declined to give evidence.
