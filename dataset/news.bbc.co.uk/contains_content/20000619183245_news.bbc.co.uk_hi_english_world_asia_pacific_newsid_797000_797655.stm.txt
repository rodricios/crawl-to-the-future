At the summit, the North's leader, Kim Jong-il and the South's Kim Dae-jung agreed on a range of measures to reduce tension between their two states.

The US government says the sanctions easing is designed to improve relations and to "encourage North Korea to refrain
from testing long-range missiles."



North Korea agreed to halt its tests after lengthy negotiations last summer, when the US said sanctions would be slackened in return.

The three-year war, between the Soviet-backed North and the US-backed South, left a legacy of hostility between Washington and Pyongang which outlasted even the Cold War.
