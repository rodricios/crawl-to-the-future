In what was described as a letter of congratulation, commander-in-chief Colonel-General Nebojsa Pavkovic said the army was ready to "accept the citizens' will and all lawful decisions made by the election bodies".

The move allayed fears of a show of force by any army units still loyal to Mr Milosevic.
The federal parliament, elected at the same time as the 24 September presidential election, may meet for the first time later on Saturday and inaugurate Mr Kostunica as president.





In his televised resignation statement Mr Milosevic said he intends to rebuild his party and stage a political comeback. Correspondents say this is unrealistic.
His hated son Marko Milosevic is flying to Moscow with his wife and child, according to eyewitnesses quoted by Reuters news agency.


I wish  all citizens of Yugoslavia much success in the coming mandate of the new president

On the streets of Belgrade, thousands of people partied through the night at a victory rally for Mr Kostunica, who was brought to power through Thursday's mass demonstrations, ending Mr Milosevic's 13-year rule.

The two men met for an hour on Friday following Mr Kostunica's decision to form a crisis committee to govern the country.

During the meeting the former president accepted his opponent's victory.

International support

Mr Kostunica was bolstered further by a message of congratulation from China's President Jiang Zemin, formerly one of Mr Milosevic' key supporters.

"We wish you success in the major task of bringing stability, prosperity and happiness to the Yugoslavian people," Chinese state television quoted Mr Jiang's message to Mr Kostunica as saying.

His words echoed those of the rest of the international community, which has warmly welcomed Mr Kostunica's success.

US President Bill Clinton said a cloud over the Balkans had been lifted, and called the removal of Mr Milosevic "an extraordinary victory" for the people of Yugoslavia and the world.

The White House said the US, along with its European allies, would move quickly to lift sanctions once it was clear that Mr Milosevic had been removed from power.

France has also initiated moves to begin Yugoslavia's international rehabilitation, inviting Mr Kostunica to attend an informal EU meeting in Biarritz in France next week.

French President Jacques Chirac said EU leaders planned to discuss European assistance for the emergence of a democratic Yugoslavia.
Transition of power

Moves to shore up support for Mr Kostunica  gathered pace throughout the day on Friday.

Russian recognition of Mr Kostunica - seen as key factor in ensuring Mr Milosevic's removal - came in a meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Mr Milosevic on Friday.

Mr Ivanov also held separate talks with Mr Kostunica, in which he congratulated him on his election victory, and handed him a message of goodwill from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
And in an about-face, Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court, which last week backed Mr Milosevic's plans for an election runoff, ruled that Mr Kostunica had won an outright victory.

Although the mood in Yugoslavia is jubilant, most analysts agree that Mr Kostunica faces a formidable task in firmly establishing himself in power and rebuilding Serbia's economy, which has been devastated by war and sanctions.
