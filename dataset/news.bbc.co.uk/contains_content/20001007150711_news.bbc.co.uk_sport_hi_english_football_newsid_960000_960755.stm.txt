Keegan believes that his side started to prove they had made progress in the 1-1 draw with France in September.



"We'll know pretty soon whether we're back on the right track or suffering a hangover from Euro 2000 but I think we have turned the corner against France," Keegan said.



"I felt personally that was a big turning point, to go there and play like we did, when everyone was knocking us - and rightly so - for our performance in Euro 2000. That showed a lot of character and spirit.



"I don't think we have to beat Germany. I think that if we drew and then went to Finland and got a good result, we'd look at the table and everything would be a little bit clearer, but nothing would be decided.



"You mustn't lose, I think. That would be a bad result for us, if we were to lose. A draw is never a disaster at this level but we must go out on our own patch, looking to beat the Germans.



"We have to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that the last game at Wembley is memorable - and memorable for all the right reasons with a victory hopefully."



Keegan's determination to seek victory means that he is likely to field a 4-4-2 formation with either Dennis Wise or Paul Ince replacing the injured Steve Gerrard alongside Paul Scholes, with Beckham and Nick Barmby on the flanks.



But some reports claim Aston Villa's Gareth Southgate will start the match in a pivotal midfield role.



Many have argued that England would be better served by an extra midfielder, as deployed in three of their best recent displays against Argentina, Ukraine and France.
