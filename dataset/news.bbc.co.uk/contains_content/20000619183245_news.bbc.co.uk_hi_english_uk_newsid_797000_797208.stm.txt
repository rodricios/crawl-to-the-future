"People went off on holiday and, realising that brandy was a third of the price on the continent, would load up the car with a few cases. Searches were very much hit and miss.



"Today, the main problems are bootleggers and drugs, in particular."



Those caught with drugs rarely put up much resistance, Mr Feeney says.



"Your average drug smuggler is pretty compliant. They've been nicked with 20kgs of heroin, they know they're going down, they know it's not worth making it worse for themselves.



"The bootleggers are the problem. A lot of them are unemployed and they're hard nuts. 



"Until recently they were getting away with it - 10 or 15 white vans filled with booze and cigarettes would roll off the ferry at a time, and once you'd pulled out the first couple, you couldn't get the rest.



"But now we've got more officers on the ground and they get quite considerable abuse - mostly verbal. We've had one or two officers injured. 



"The bootleggers will see a customs officer in the terminal, drop their bag filled with cigarettes and charge like they would on a rugby field."



Even out of uniform and off-duty, the officers can cop flak.



"Dover is quite a small town and there's a big community of asylum seekers and a big community of bootleggers.  



"You could go out for a drink with a friend, and sitting at the next table will be four or five people you nicked the day before - it can get a bit ferocious.



"Some hang around outside Customs and Excise, waiting for off-duty officers to come out. They'll follow them, saying 'I've got your number.'"
