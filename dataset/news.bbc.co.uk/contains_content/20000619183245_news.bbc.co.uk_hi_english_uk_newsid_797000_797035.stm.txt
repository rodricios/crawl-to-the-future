"These people have disgraced our nation and our national game," Mr Straw told MPs.

Moves to stop hooligans travelling abroad would be "the number one priority over the next few months", he added.

The FA's chief executive, Adam Crozier, said: "We support any such legislation."

England Coach Kevin Keegan appealed to England fans to behave at Tuesday's match with Romania, saying a ban on England would be "devastating" for the team.

Mr Straw said he would also consider introducing a single banning order for domestic and international matches with mandatory passport conditions, as well as powers for the courts in respect of unconvicted hooligans.

'serious risks'

But human rights group Liberty warned of "serious risks" of taking action against people who had not been convicted of a crime.

Liz Parratt said: "People are innocent until proven guilty - and in a public order situation it is particularly easy to target the wrong people by mistake.

"Very few of the fans deported at the weekend were 'known football hooligans' - most of them were arrested simply for not having passports."

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has discussed the violence with his Belgian counterpart Guy Verhofstadt at the EU summit in Portugal.
