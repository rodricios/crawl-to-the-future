The commission was accused of being "conspicuously unfair" for rejecting a bid for the licence from current operator Camelot, rivals to Sir Richard's People's Lottery bid.

Despite criticism of the commissioners' decision only to deal with the People's Lottery - which was given an extra month to improve its bid - Mr Howarth praised their "very great ability" in interviews.

Commission chairman Dame Helena Shovelton resigned in the wake of the court ruling, blaming media "vilification".

The Department of Culture, Media and Sport has confirmed Mr Howarth was previously paid by Sir Richard, but said he had declared all financial interests.

Commons register

He had also played no part in decisions on the allocation of the Lottery licence.

A spokesman said: "He was a paid adviser, primarily for Virgin's airlines, from 1992 to 1996." 

"He is sure that it is in the Commons Register of Members' Interests for all the years that he had a connection with Sir Richard."

As minister for the arts Mr Howarth, who defected to Labour from the Conservatives in 1995, is not normally involved in National Lottery issues.

"Mischief-making"

He told the Daily Mail newspaper he had given interviews about the commission only
because other culture department ministers were unavailable.

He said he had reminded civil servants of his previous interest before speaking.

Any suggestion that he had been behaving improperly would be "mischief-making", he told the paper.

But shadow culture secretary Peter Ainsworth said: "The fact that Alan
Howarth has had a financial relationship with Richard Branson makes it entirely
inappropriate that he should be involved."
