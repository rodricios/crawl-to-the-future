 We dived into a doorway, but the tanks were not heading in our direction.  They were going up towards the main boulevard, the parliament building and state-run television.

We came to some offices of the United Nations.  Milos talked his way past the security guard and I dashed into an empty room.

Within moments I was back on air, much to the surprise of colleagues in London who thought I had left the country.
Inferno

Then we went back onto the streets.  I ran ahead of Milos and Irena, and found myself right in front of the television building which by now was an inferno.  Through the broken windows I could see chairs and tables on fire.

People were running away from the building, carrying off computer equipment. "It's a trophy," one man cried, a video recorder tucked under his arm. 

And the trophies got better.  In the park opposite the burning parliament building, I met a man carrying a ceremonial chair over his head.  Was it from the parliament?   You bet it was.

Running down a side street thick with black smoke, we passed the main police station.

It was besieged by protesters, about 100 of them.  They were kicking at the doors and windows, some people emerged carrying police helmets and riot shields.

Finally we made it to my office.  For the next three hours I barely moved from my desk, the phone clamped to my ear and people running in and out of my room with information.
Trashed

We left the office late at night and started the long walk back to the flat.  At the corner we passed Scandal, a vulgar perfume shop belonging to Mr Milosevic's son, Marko. 

There wasn't a shard of glass left in the window, or a bottle of perfume left in the shop.  The place was trashed.

I the impartial and objective reporter surprised myself, punching a fist into the air and shouting, "Yes!"  Irena was dancing along beside me.

I have lived in Belgrade for two years.  This is my city and the people around me on the streets were, in a way, my people. 

That night I shared their joy, their emotion, and their hopes for the future.
