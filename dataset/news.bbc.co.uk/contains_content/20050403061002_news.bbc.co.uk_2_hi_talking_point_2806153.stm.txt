        We heard your tributes to Pope John Paul II in a special edition of Talking Point. Our guests were the Archbishop of Cardiff, Peter Smith, and Papal biographer, Michael Walsh.

Rome authorities have urged pilgrims to stay away from the city centre, saying it cannot cope with any more before Friday's funeral of Pope John Paul II.

About one million people are waiting to see the Pope lying in state at St Peter's Basilica but the queue is now cut off to newcomers.

Scores of world leaders including US President George W Bush will attend Friday's funeral. 

Meanwhile, cardinals have met again in the Vatican to discuss arrangements for the gathering, known as a conclave, that will elect a new Pope at the end of this month.

John Paul II died on Saturday night at the age of 84 following a series of worsening health problems including heart failure.

Send us your tributes to Pope John Paul II using the form on the right hand side. Are you planning on travelling to Rome to pay your respects to the Pope? Send us your thoughts and experiences.

You have been a great man of God on this world. This can be evidenced by millions of people from different faiths around the world that are mourning your death. May your greatness on the world also reign in heaven. May the lord God reward you for all the good you have done on this world. Rest in peace. Bahizi Ignatius, Uganda 

I'll miss you Pope. You are the greatest Pole.Pawel R, Poland

We have been truly blessed to have had a man so holy guide us through our faith.Angie Tschopp, U.S.A. 

Thank you Holy Father for loving us so much, for loving Slovakia, my country that you visited. You loved all the people around the world and we owe it to you to love and appreciate each other no matter what religion and country we come from! Slovakia loves you. Katarina, Slovakia 

Never knew him personally but a great source of inspiration for integrity and commitment especially in his last days. Hats off to him!SS, Singapore 

Let me start by saying that I feel like a sheep that has lost its shepherd. He was a beautiful man, a holy man and a human being. I looked up to him and I pray for him and the individual who walks in his shoes. They will be big shoes to fill. May we all walk in Peace with Christ.Ann Gleavy, USA 

Through the Pope I learned of peace. A great leader of the millennium. Your countless achievements on earth will be rewarded in heaven, a place where you rightly belong. Rest in peace.Stella Wanki Mmbi, Cameroon.

To me, Pope John Paul II was a man of vision and will be missed by people of all religions. He indeed did a lot not only for Christianity but for humanity such as helping to end Communism. He indeed will be missed. The world has lost a great man but his spirit will live on.Jorge , USA 

His preaching about oneness and praying without ceasing was so touching even to the non-Catholics, he was so great, may his soul rest in peace.Cornelius Kaphantengo, Malawi 

He was our pillar and will be remembered for all his good work.Rita Chewe, Zambia 

Those queues. For the last time, take the Pope to the people. His body should be moved onto an open top hearse and taken in dignity slowly past the crowds. It's the only way everyone will get to see him, and I am certain that he himself would appreciate his last public appearance.Arthur, UK 

We lost a great man who would have a great say on world peace. Pope John Paul II is a living saint. We mourn his untimely death.Nathan Alvarez, Philippines 

The great Pope John Paul II has led me through an era of corruption and indecency. He has taught me the error of my ways and he has led me to the right path. Matthew Cutmore, England 

The Pope has lead his Catholic people for many years through hate and sorrow and he has shown them the way to lead an equal and innocent life. James Russell, England 

The Pope has been a great ambassador to all the Catholics and the rest of the worldWilliam Worton, England 

Indeed he had a heart for the heartless, was a father to the fatherless He's gone and still will be remembered by many. We will always carry his good ways towards humanity in our thoughts and prayers. Eternal Rest Grant Unto Him, Amen.

Pope John Paul II is the only Pope I have known, and respected, since I was born. His death has brought about a sense of deep sadness, a feeling I cannot comprehend which makes it so clear that this great man truly had indeed a connection with the young people, no matter how far they were. I will continue to pray for him and uphold the traditions of the church he so strongly believed. His faith has stood the test of time, let us learn from his example.Soundarie David, Sri Lanka 

When I heard that he died I cried like a small girl. I just want to say THANK YOU for being with ma all my life, You were my inspiration, my hope for a better tomorrow. Thank You John Paul II. Margaret, Poland 

Thank you John Paul II for being the people's Pope. You reached out to us and now we reach out to you. You taught us the values of dignity, love, faith and life. Thank you for coming to Scotland in 1982. I was so lucky to see you at Bellahouston and Murrayfield, and then also in Rome. These memories will always be with us. The sign we carried said "JPII we love you" Always in our hearts. Agnes McCluskey, Scotland 

You were a man of God, a true representative of God. People of all nations, regardless of their religions, beliefs, colour, traditions, and even the non-believers, looked up to you and bowed their heads for you in admiration and respect. May God grant the 117 cardinals the wisdom and strength to choose wisely the man to fit those simple brown leather shoes that carried John Paul throughout the world so close to us all. May his soul rest in well-deserved eternal peace. Amen.Martha and Alphonce Lyimo, Tanzania

No more suffering, no more pain, you are now with our Heavenly Father. May you rest in everlasting peace. Thank you for sharing and caring for your brothers and sisters, all over the world. You will be sadly missed.Jennie Lougheed, England 

Although we are sad at the demise of our beloved Pope, we are happy with the knowledge that he is in heaven. Never have we Catholics been so devout and fervent in our worship than under his leadership. We hope and pray the next Pope will follow in his footsteps.Rosemary De Souza, Kuwait
