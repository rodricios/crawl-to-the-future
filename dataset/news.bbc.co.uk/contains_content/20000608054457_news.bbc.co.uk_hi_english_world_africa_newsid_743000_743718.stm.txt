The shipment apparently included Kalashnikov assault rifles, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, surface-to-air missiles and anti-tank  weapons, and may have been only one of five such deliveries in 1998 and 1999.

It has been estimated that the RUF has 5,000 to 10,000 combat troops, though experts say the figure would be higher if arms-carrying youngsters were included in the count.

As part of its efforts to disarm them the UN had taken 4,000 weapons from the rebels by the end of April.


UN forces



The UN  has complained that its peacekeeping operations are conducted on a shoestring, leading to problems with equipment failure, while others say that the peacekeepers simply haven't got the powerful weapons they need.

Defence analysts say a disciplined, well-armed force - such as the Western units sent to Bosnia and Kosovo - would have little difficulty in deterring Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF).

The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Marcus, says that one of the problems of the existing UN force is that its soldiers - from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, India, Guinea, Jordan and Zambia - have little training for peacekeeping operations, and have no previous experience of working together.


The mandate of the UN force is to "stabilise" the situation, so it has the powers to shoot back and use force, but in a battle at Masiaka,  220 Nigerian and Guinean soldiers were outgunned.

Armed with only light weapons, they were forced to withdraw when their ammunition ran out.

The UN force, meanwhile, currently numbers 8,700, well below its full strength of 11,000. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called for urgent reinforcements.


Pro-government forces

Aside from the UN, the forces facing the RUF are the Sierra Leonean Army (SLA) - which is currently allied with the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) headed by former military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma - and civil defence forces including the Kamajors, militiamen originally from a tribe of hunters.
