A policeman in India has been suspended after television channels broadcast shocking images of him beating a woman. 

In the footage, the officer is seen slapping the woman and pushing her to the ground. 

The 26-year-old woman, a member of the low-caste Dalit community, is a suspect in the murder of her husband, whose body was found in their house on Tuesday. 

Correspondents say that the beating highlights the widespread problem of police brutality in India. 

According to Indian law, there are strict guidelines on the arrest of a woman. 

A woman suspect can only be handled by a woman police officer and male policemen are not allowed to touch her.
