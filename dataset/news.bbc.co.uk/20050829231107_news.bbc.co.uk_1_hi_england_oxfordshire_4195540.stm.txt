Police launched an investigation after the first body, a 41-year-old man, was found by a member of the public in Leach Road in Bicester on Monday.



Later, a man and a woman, both 23, were discovered after paramedics were called to a house in the village of Ambrosden.



Police say they are treating the death of the 41-year-old man as suspicious and believe the three deaths may be linked.




A Thames Valley Police spokesman said post-mortem examinations were scheduled to be carried later.
