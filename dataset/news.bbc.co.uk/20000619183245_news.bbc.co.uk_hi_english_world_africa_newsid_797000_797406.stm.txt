Ethiopia says it has pulled its forces out of the western Eritrean town of Tesseney, less than 24 hours after the two countries signed a ceasefire deal.

The town, which is 120 km inside the disputed border close to Sudan, has changed hands several times in the latter stages of the two-year border war, and was retaken by Ethiopian forces last week. 

Government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said on Monday: "Having successfully completed their mission, the Ethiopian defence forces withdrew from Tesseney this morning to positions from which they can defend themselves." 

There has been no confirmation yet from Eritrea. 

Correspondents suggest the latest withdrawal could be as much a tactical move as a gesture towards the peace accord signed in Algeria on Sunday.


	
		
		
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
	



A first group of displaced Ethiopian civilians who had been living in Eritrea have began their journey back to Ethiopia as part of a voluntary repatriation  programme organised by the Red Cross.   

About 500 mainly women children and the elderly  were the first to leave out of about 4,000 Ethiopians sheltering under trees by the road near the southern Eritrean town of Adi Keih. 

They will travel by bus across the border. Those scheduled to leave formed queues, each queue representing a different village where they had originally lived.  

During the border war, thousands of Ethiopians in Eritrea and Eritreans in Ethiopia have found themselves unable to return home and encountered hostility, loss of income, detention and restrictions on their movements.

Swift action needed

Welcoming the peace accord, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said UN forces should move swiftly to bolster the peace deal. 

"We need to try and implement the agreement very quickly," he said.

Mr Annan, on a Middle East tour, told a news conference in Cairo that the UN Security Council would now decide on a request for peacekeepers as part of the deal brokered by the Organisation of African Unity.

The UN plans to send reconnaissance teams to both countries before recommending to the council what kind of force would be needed.

Calls for end to hostilities













25 km buffer zone inside Eritrean territory













2,000 UN peacekeepers to be deployed













Ethiopian troops to return to pre-war positions within two weeks of UN deployment















Meanwhile, the French news agency, AFP, is reporting from Addis Ababa that the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary and Democratic Front has won last month's general election, taking 472 of the 522 seats.  

The agency says the eight opposition parties demanded the poll should be re-run, complaining that it was disrupted by harassment, and that the EPRDF denied them access to the media. 


Handshake

On Sunday in Algiers, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin and his Eritrean counterpart Haile Woldensae shook hands after signing the accord.

The two ministers had not talked to each other during weeks of indirect negotiations in the Algerian capital, forcing international mediators to shuttle between them as they tried to narrow their differences.

They vowed to work for a lasting settlement of the conflict in which some 100,000 soldiers from both sides have been killed and many more people have been displaced.

The ceasefire appears to favour Ethiopia, which maintains its army in the disputed areas, while Eritrean forces must withdraw from a 25km (15 miles) buffer zone inside their  own territory to make way for peacekeepers.

There have been no reports of clashes since the guns on the front line fell silent, as agreed, on Friday.
