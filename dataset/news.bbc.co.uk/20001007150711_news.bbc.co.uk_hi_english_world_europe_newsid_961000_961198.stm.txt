Slobodan Milosevic said in a television broadcast on Friday that he now looked forward to resting a bit and spending more time with his grandson, also called Marko.

"Given the end of this huge responsibility which I carried for a whole decade, I intend to rest a bit, to spend more time with my family, especially with my grandson Marko, and then continue to strengthen my party," Milosevic said.

Marko Milosevic is reported to own an amusement complex in his father's home town of Pozarevac, which was ransacked during the recent protests.

His business interests are also believed to include a bakery, a store selling computer equipment, a disco club and a luxurious perfume shop in central Belgrade, named Scandal, which was also looted by rampaging protesters on Thursday.
