However, with no nest as a meeting point, scientists have often wondered how the birds find each other in the crowd when they return from a hunt. 

The team at Paris University say the penguins have two separate sound-producing structures, and calls are made when the sound from each of these combines to create a unique vocal identity code. 
Evening dress
Professor Clive Catchpole is an expert in animal communications at Royal Holloway, University of London, and has followed the French research closely.

He says the findings are fascinating: "These penguins have to breed down in the Antarctic in the winter, when it is dark, minus 40 degrees and snowing.  And the problem is they can't actually see each other until they are really close - and as you know, they all wear evening dress."

Professor Catchpole says the birds must learn the individual acoustic bar-codes very early, perhaps even in the egg.

"The remarkable thing we don't really understand yet is how the birds can pick out one call when it is drowned  by a larger volume of noise.  This is what is called in psychology the cocktail party effect: you can hear someone talking about you across a crowded room."
