Government drugs czar Keith Hellawell has estimated the proceeds of up to a third of property crime are spent on heroin and crack cocaine alone.

The home secretary is also concerned about the length of time it takes to provide treatment as well as the programme's success rate.

In some areas, help can be provided in a matter of days or weeks, while in others it can take months or years, he told his audience.

"Every day they are kept waiting is another day they are out on drugs and potentially committing crime," Mr Straw said.

The agency - which will not cover Scotland, which has its own drugs strategy - will bolster the government's 10-year strategy to reduce abuse.

Persistent dealers already face a minimum seven-year sentence and schemes referring abusers to treatment programmes have been introduced at every police custody suite.

Criminals who abuse drugs will face treatment and testing orders from October.

The home secretary's ideas have been welcomed by drugs treatment charity Turning Point.
   
Chief executive Ted Unsworth said: "These proposed 
changes should help bring a greater consistency to treatment.
   
"The setting of minimum standards should also help ensure good 
quality drug services are a standard, not an exception, and help reduce waiting lists which can often be measured in months.
 
"Our only reservation is whether the larger combined budget will be 
subject to cuts which would set back the fight against drugs."
