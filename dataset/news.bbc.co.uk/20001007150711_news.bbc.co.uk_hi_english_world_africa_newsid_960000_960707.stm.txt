The UK Government is set to announce a reinforcement of Britain's military commitment to Sierra Leone in the next few days.



Few details are being provided about the size or nature of the reinforcement, but British diplomats at the UN say they are confident the extra contribution will help stabilise the troubled UN force in the West African country.



Since India pulled its 3,000-strong contingent out of the UN force in Sierra Leone in September, Britain has been under pressure to take a lead in strengthening the operation.



British diplomats will not give precise details of what is envisaged, but they say Britain will be providing extra military support both on the ground and off-shore.



One option being discussed is an over-the-horizon British rapid reaction force based at sea. Another is a contingent deployed on the ground in Sierra Leone.



In either case, the force's primary role will be the protection of the British military trainers now working with the Sierra Leone army. The force could also be made available to support the UN in an emergency, such as the crisis in May when UN peacekeepers were attacked and taken hostage.



The force will remain under UK command, and it is expected to involve hundreds of soldiers.



As Sierra Leone's former colonial power, Britain hopes its increased commitment to Sierra Leone will encourage other countries to provide troops for the UN force.



Another troop contributor, Jordan, had threatened to withdraw if at least one developed nation did not become involved.



However, the UK Government may come under fire from the opposition Conservative Party, which called for the army to be withdrawn after a British soldier died during September's daring operation to rescue British troops held hostage by the West Side Boys militia.
