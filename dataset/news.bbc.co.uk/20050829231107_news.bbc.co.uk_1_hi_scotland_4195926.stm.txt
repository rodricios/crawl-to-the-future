New SNH headquarters are being built in Inverness


The move north was forced on the agency by the Scottish Executive, despite opposition from unions and MSPs.



The agency has denied having problems with recruitment following the decision to move from Edinburgh.



Only about 40 of the 270 workers opted to move to the Highlands, although the numbers employed have risen since then.




SNH said it was still looking to recruit about 70 people. There will be vacancies in scientific roles like biology and zoology, as well as administration and business management. 



It has set up a website, snhjobs.co.uk, to tell people about opportunities available.



This is being backed up with local advertising in the Highland media and a series of public open evenings. 



The Scottish Executive told SNH to make the move up the A9 in March 2003, as part of its policy of dispersing civil service jobs throughout the country.



Ian Edgeler, the SNH director in charge of the relocation, described the recruitment as "a fairly gradual process so far".



"We anticipate that from October onwards, the number of vacancies will increase, offering quality career opportunities at various levels."



Stuart Black, chief executive of Inverness Nairn Badenoch and Strathspey Enterprise, said: "SNH's move to Inverness will create substantial economic benefits for the Highlands by offering quality employment opportunities that were previously held within the central belt."



SNH is building a Â£15m headquarters on the site of a former nurses' home in the Westercraigs area.
