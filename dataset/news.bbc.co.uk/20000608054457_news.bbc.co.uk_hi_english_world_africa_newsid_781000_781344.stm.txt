There is no reliable method of identifying the characteristics of a single diamond, without damaging it.

Meanwhile, prices soar as gems proceed along the pipeline, with $6.8 billion annual international production of uncut stones being turned into 67 million pieces of jewellery worth $50 billion. 

With such potential for enrichment - in an industry renowned for secrecy - the words "ethical" and "diamonds" have seldom been used together. 

Blood diamonds

Campaigns against "conflict diamonds" or "blood diamonds" have successfully raised public awareness in the capability of diamond smuggling to provide the finance and indeed the motive for vicious civil wars. 

Fearing they might find themselves in a similar position to the fur trade, a luxury product stained by blood in the minds of consumers, the big players in the diamond industry have recently responded by promoting "ethical diamonds". 

	
		
		
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
	



An industry-backed UN embargo on diamonds from rebel-held areas in Angola is proclaimed by uncut trading giant De Beers to have had "considerable impact" on the war chest of the country's Unita rebels. 
 
De Beers admit Unita diamonds probably still appear on the market, but not via respectable traders who want to keep their reputations in the industry. 

This has reportedly caused Angolan rebels to sell stones at a 30% discount, applying a brake, if not a stranglehold, on the conflict. 

Avoiding the net

Industry analysts and politicians agree that this situation is the also best to hope for in Sierra Leone. 

No one expects diamond smuggling to be stamped out completely.
