Japan has begun a campaign to try to persuade Australians to support the abolition of a ban on commercial whaling. 



The Australian government wants to extend the ban, but Japanese whalers are taking the unusual step of putting their case to householders in the city of Adelaide, where the international whaling commission is to meet early next month. 



For the past 14 years, Japan and Norway have refused to accept a ban on commercial whaling and last year killed more than 1,000 whales between them. 



Now, Australia and New Zealand want the international commission to declare the whole of the South Pacific a whale sanctuary, and Japan is striking back. 



The Japan Whaling Association is distributing thousands of pamphlets to homes in Adelaide, arguing that banning the killing and eating of whales is putting traditional Japanese customs in danger. 



The pamphlet poses a question: 'what if foreigners told Australians they couldn't eat meat pies anymore?' 



That would be considered, quite rightly says the pamphlet, an unacceptable cultural interference, like Hindus putting a worldwide ban on the eating of cows. 



Environmental groups, who regard whales as an endangered species, have condemned the campaign as grossly misleading, saying surveys show only 1% of Japanese eat whale meat more than once a month.
