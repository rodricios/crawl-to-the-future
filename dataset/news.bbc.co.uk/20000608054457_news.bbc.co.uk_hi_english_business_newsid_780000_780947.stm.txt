The index committee announced late on Wednesday that Hanson, Scottish & Newcastle, Bookham Technology and Ocean Group will replace them.



Pharmaceutical group Celltech, which also joined in March, has been saved from relegation by a recent rally in its share price. The changes to the index are based on Tuesday's closing price.



When they joined in March, the move was hailed as a brave new dawn for tech stocks and the biggest shake-up of the index since it was launched in 1982.



Their quick exit from the market may be unusual but as one equity analyst said "look at the market for the last six months, is that usual?"



"It's normal service re-establishing itself," said Jeremy Batstone of NatWest Stockbrokers.



"The surprise is not so much the fall in the 'new economy' companies but the tail-wind that prevailed over the previous 12 months."



Tremendous volatility in stocks worldwide has seen the valuations of many technology companies slashed, with many investors opting to put their money in what they perceive to be safer stocks.



The volatility has been triggered by fears that many internet companies' profitability will never match their valuations.



This has been compounded by rising interest rates, which cut into corporate profits, as the US central bank has tried to bring the booming economy gently back to earth.



"They were caught up in a wave which bumped them into the FTSE and which may bump them out again," one equity analyst said.



There have been few fundamental changes in the fortunes of these companies.



"All these stocks have core strengths, which haven't changed in the past three months," he added.
