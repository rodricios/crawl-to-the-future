His solicitor, Nick Makin, said he was delighted there would be swift action over the allegations of intimidation.



Martin's lawyers say the main plank of their appeal is that the judge misdirected the jury and their client did not receive a fair trial.



So far, little hard evidence of jury intimidation has been made public. 



No juror has complained to the police and after an investigation, court officials decided to take no further action.



But there were reports shortly after the verdict that some of the jury members felt threatened in the courtroom.



The farmer, who claimed he had fired in self-defence, has since described the death of Barras as "regrettable" and says he had not intended to kill him.



The case provoked widespread debate over issues of self-defence and rural policing.



A date has not yet been set for the full appeal hearing.
