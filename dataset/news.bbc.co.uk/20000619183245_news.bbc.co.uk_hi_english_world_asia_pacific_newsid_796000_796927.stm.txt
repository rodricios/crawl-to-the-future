"It's not correct for me to put myself in any position and so I'm exiting."  



Mr Speight  has submitted a list of approved candidates he would like to see sit on the new civilian government.  



He said they were committed to the cause of indigenous rights and would serve the country well.  



Like the military, Mr Speight said negotiations were well advanced and was optimistic the crisis would be resolved soon.  



However, racial tensions in Fiji remain high. There was gunfire in the capital, Suva, early on Monday when three armed men stormed the city's police headquarters in search of an ethnic Indian prisoner.



Reports said the gunmen were searching for an ethnic Indian soldier charged with killing an indigenous Fijian soldier during peacekeeping duties in the Middle East.



Meanwhile, industry officials have said the country is on the verge of an economic crisis with sugar cane rotting in the fields and tourists
staying away after the coup.
