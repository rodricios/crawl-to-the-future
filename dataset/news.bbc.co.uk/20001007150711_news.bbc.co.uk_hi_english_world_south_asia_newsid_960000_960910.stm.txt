The poachers are thought to have broken in during the night, possibly with help from staff inside.

Tiger body parts are prized ingredients in traditional eastern medicine and are often smuggled to China, Japan and other south-east Asian countries.


Dwindling population

India's tiger population has fallen to about 3,500 from 4,300 just 11 years ago, largely because of poaching and loss of habitat.

They represent roughly half of the total number of tigers in the world.

This is the first case of a tiger being killed in an Indian zoo, though there have been hundreds of cases of poaching from wildlife sanctuaries.

The incident follows the death of 13 Royal Bengal tigers from a parasitic infection at the Nandankanan Zoo in the state of Orissa in July - a major embarrassment for the Indian Government.

Last month the country's Supreme Court called for strict government measures to protect the country's dwindling tiger population, both in zoos and the wild.

In 1999, Indian wildlife agencies recovered 21 tiger skins and 137 nails.
