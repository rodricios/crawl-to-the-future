The camp does not have any permanent buildings - trees offer the only shelter from the heat of the sun. 


All at the camp say they are ill, most with diarrhoea. The authorities let them go to hospital for medicines.


      An elderly woman told reporters: "We are not badly treated but we 
have nothing to eat. We are dirty and we sleep on the ground like 
dogs."


The people were taken to Sheketi about 10 days ago. 



   Mr Tesfai denied that his government was pursuing a policy of compulsory repatriation. 



He said an internal memorandum sent out to local authorities saying Ethiopians should register for repatriation was the result of what he called "a
communications gap".


   "The policy has always been:
those who wish to stay can stay and those who wish to leave
can leave," he said.
  


However, Ethiopians living in Eritrea have become more fearful about their safety since Ethiopian forces launched a cross-border advance on 12 May. 


Peace talks in Algiers remain stalled and sporadic fighting has been reported over the past few days at several points along the border. 


An additional reason for Ethiopians to be nervous about possible reprisals is that they have taken many of the jobs left unfilled by Eritreans who have gone to the front. 


Ethiopians are not called up for military service in Eritrea.
