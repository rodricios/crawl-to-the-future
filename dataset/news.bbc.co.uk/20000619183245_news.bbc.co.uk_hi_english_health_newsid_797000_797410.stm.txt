Mr Neale reassured Mrs Wright-Hogeland that she was "fit and well" throughout 1994 and 1995 as she continued to complain of pain.



By New Year's Eve, 1994, her abdomen had swollen so much that she had to cut her tights in order to move comfortably.



She had also bled throughout the whole of December and her distended abdomen was so tender that it burned to the touch,
she told the hearing.



In February 1995 Mrs Wright-Hogeland had to have a complete hysterectomy and both ovaries removed.



The surgeon found numerous cysts - including one the size of a grapefrui -t and several abscesses, including one the size of a hen's egg, she told the inquiry.



After the surgery she spoke to Mr Neale who said he was shocked by the extent of her problems.



She said: "He said that was the worst case he had seen in his life or career, which was very shocking considering all the assurances he had given me over the
previous six years.





Mrs Wright-Hogeland developed an infection at the site of her wound after leaving hospital.



But when she contacted Mr Neale he blamed her for refusing antibiotics while in hospital - something about which she has no recollection.



Mrs Wright-Hogeland said that the pain became worse, but she could not contact Mr Neale.



Eventually, they had a bad tempered face-to-face meeting, at which she claimed he said: "Do not bother to sue me, you will spend thousands and thousands and you will not get anywhere.



"I work as an expert witness and I know how the system works.



"I have friends in high places. You will never get me."



Mrs Wright-Hogeland required ten days in hospital for intensive treatment to her wound.



Mr Neale, 52, of Boroughbridge, near York, north Yorkshire, faces 35 allegations relating to 14 women patients. 



He is also accused of two charges of falsifying his CV to win a post assessing other doctors' performances.



Mr Neale denies serious professional misconduct.
