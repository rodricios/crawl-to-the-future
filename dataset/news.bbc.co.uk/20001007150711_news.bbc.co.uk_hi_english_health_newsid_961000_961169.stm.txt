Universities Hospitals Trust in March.

Like all junior doctors, Dr Julyan has to complete training as a house officer
rotating through various hospital departments - including gynaecology.

He said he was asked at the interview if he would ever "clerk a patient
in for an abortion" - a process which involves taking the patient's history and doing an examination.

He replied: "No."



Dr Julyan said: "I was called the next day and told I hadn't got the job
because of that answer.

'Discrimination' claim


"I was utterly devastated. My wife was in tears, I was
distraught."




He told the newspaper: "The difference with this case is that discrimination
has never been verbally acknowledged before.

"If you don't get a job there is no onus on the employer to say why. But they
volunteered the information."



Dr Julyan said that he wanted to do a rotation in gynaecology because much of a general
practitioner's work is in that field.

'Deeply distressing'

"Without a grounding in gynaecology, I would be inadequately equipped to look
after my patients and serve the public," he said.


"Given my views I find it deeply distressing that anyone should suggest being
a gynaecologist requires conducting abortions."
He said he had decided to go public with his allegations to stop other
doctors being discriminated against in the same way.

The hospital trust was at the centre of controversy earlier this year when Scotland's only heart surgeon resigned from the transplant unit it runs at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
