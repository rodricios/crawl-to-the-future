Zainab Kalokoh was originally from Sierra Leone


A 14-year-old from Peckham, south-east London, and a 16-year-old of nearby New Cross, are accused of the killing of Zainab Kalokoh.



The 33-year-old, of Stratford, east London, was shot on Saturday night in front of 100 guests in Peckham.



The pair were remanded by Camberwell Green magistrates until 7 September.




They were also charged with robbing the guests.



A post-mortem examination found the victim, who was originally from Sierra Leone, died from a single gunshot wound to the head.



The baby, who is not related to Ms Kalokoh, was unhurt.



Two other men arrested on Sunday, aged 19 and 33, have been bailed by police to return in about a month.



The shooting happened at a community hall on the Wood Dene Estate at about 2000 BST.
