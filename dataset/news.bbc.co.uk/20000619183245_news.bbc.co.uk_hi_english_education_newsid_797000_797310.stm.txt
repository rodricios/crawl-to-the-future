Some are dyslexics whose condition was not diagnosed while they were at school, or people with long-term health conditions or other problems such as homelessness.

Typically they start out with only half the necessary level of academic qualifications to be accepted onto a course at Dundee. 

Who benefits most?

At the end of the free 11-week summer school there is a final examination.  If students complete the whole process - and 96% usually do - they are guaranteed a place in the faculty of their choice.

Once in the university, the drop-out rate for those who have been on the course is just 5%.  Dundee's overall figure is about 10%. The UK average is 16%.  

"Who are the students that are most likely to benefit from higher education, and how do you make that decision?" asks Dr Blicharski. 

The traditional answer had been "Those students who achieve most through school". 

But why then did they drop out? 

"Students often do sign up for courses without really realising what they are.  Often they don't realise the stresses and strains of living away from home," he said. 

"Just because you are a straight-As student doesn't mean you are going to cope."
