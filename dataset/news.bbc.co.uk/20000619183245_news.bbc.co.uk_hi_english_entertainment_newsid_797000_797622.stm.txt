But the sequel two years later did not prove as successful and the comedy actor's career has been static ever since.





Crocodile Dundee was based on the true story of Rodney Ansell, who was stranded on an unihabited island for two months in 1977 when a crocodile tipped his boat over.





He survived by shooting sharks and buffalo and drinking their blood.





Hogan liked the story and, together with Ken Shadie and John  Cornell, transformed it into a movie.





In it, Hogan plays Michael J. Dundee, who shows New York reporter Sue Charlton - played by Linda Kozlowski - around the dangerous Australian Bush.  




 
She in turn then takes him to New York, where he has to try and adapt to city life, with hilarious consequences.



Since the film was released, Hogan, a former stand-up comedian, has seen his subsequent movies, including Flipper and  Lightning Jack, flop at the box office.




Foley said Crocodile Dundee would be filmed at the Movie World Studios on the Gold Coast and other locations nearby before switching to Los Angeles.   



Ansell was shot dead by police in August last year after killing a police officer in a shoot-out.
