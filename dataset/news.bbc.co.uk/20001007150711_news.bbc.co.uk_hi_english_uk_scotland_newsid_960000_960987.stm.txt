more than usual. We suspect this might be because of Prince
William," said Jenny Scott, the British Council's director of
education promotion in Washington.

 US students were also said to be interested in
British universities because of the strong dollar and rumours that
Chelsea Clinton might follow her father to Oxford University.

More than 30,000 US students came to Britain to study in
1999.

William is enjoying an adventurous year off which has already
taken him to Belize in Central America and Rodrigues in the
Indian Ocean.

He is
currently in Chile sleeping in a tent in Patagonia as part of an
expedition that will see him building bridges and observing
the local wildlife.



Hottest date


William is no stranger to female admirers, having been flanked by excited young girls pleading for his hand in marriage during his first overseas engagement in 1998.

He was also voted as a woman's hottest date for 2000 by Tatler magazine.


William gained an A grade in geography, a B in history of art and a C in biology this year to enable him to take up the St Andrews course.



British furniture, architecture, Renaissance Italy and modern art are among the topics the Prince will be taught. 


Scotland's oldest university was founded in 1411 and has a lengthy Royal heritage. 


Many Scottish kings went to St Andrews until the 16th Century.
