He was arrested after an 
investigation into the origin of the Love Bug led to a flat which he shared with his girlfriend.



Mr Ramones claimed it was a case of mistaken identity.


Officials did not say if they
would bring any charges against other suspects.


The prosecutor said the country's National Bureau of Investigation could not produce the extra evidence ordered by a court to allow a case against Mr Ramones to proceed under the Access Device Act.


    The act deals with illegal use of passwords for credit
cards or bank accounts for money.
    


The NBI has identified other possible suspects, including former
computing student Onel de Guzman.


Mr de Guzman, a former student at the AMA Computer College in Manila, was the brother of Mr Ramones' girlfriend and shared their flat.
