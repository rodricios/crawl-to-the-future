Feversham will be the third Muslim independent school to become maintained, but will be the first secondary one.

The others are the Islamia Primary School in Brent, north London - set up by former folk singer Yusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens - and Al Furquan Primary School in Birmingham.

All schools coming into the maintained sector must comply with the statutory provisions governing maintained schools, including delivery of the National Curriculum.

'Favourably disposed'
Mr Blunkett has written to Feversham's promoters, and to Bradford's Local Education Authority, to say he was "favourably disposed" to a move into the state-maintained sector.

Government scrutiny confirmed that Feversham's 41% pass rate of GCSEs at A-C grade was satisfactory. 

Feversham first sought state backing in 1994, when the then Conservative-led government rejected a bid because of doubts about viability.

A second attempt two years later was also unsuccessful.
