Heather disappeared on 25 August as she went to meet a girlfriend for a night out. Her friend raised the alarm when she did not arrive.

Heather's body was discovered in undergrowth the following morning. She had been strangled.

Tamworth came to a standstill on Friday for the teenager's funeral.

Hundreds of people lined the streets, as a horse-drawn glass carriage carried Heather's coffin from her home to St Editha's Church in the town centre.

The dance student had dreamt of being a cruise ship dancer.
