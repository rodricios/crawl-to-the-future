Released in 1971, it stars Richard Rowntree as Detective John  Shaft as he tries to track down the kidnapped daughter of a mobster. 




Jackson takes on the role in the updated version, with Rowntree starring in a cameo as his Uncle John.




Directed by John Singleton, it sees Jackson up against it as he tries to put a college student behind bars for the murder of a black student.





As well as the killer himself, he finds himself doing battle with some of his colleagues on the force and a Dominican drug baron as he tries to find the key witness that would put them all away.





As the forces of evil close in on him, he has only a streetwise confidante played by Busta Rhymes and a female officer (Vanessa Williams) for back-up. 





The comedy Big Momma's House continued to do well at the box office, taking $11.3m (�5m) to claim third place, ahead of Mission Impossible: 2, which made $10.9m (�2m).





New movies Titan A.E and Boys and Girls took fifth and sixth places respectively.   



Shaft is due for a UK release on 3 November.
