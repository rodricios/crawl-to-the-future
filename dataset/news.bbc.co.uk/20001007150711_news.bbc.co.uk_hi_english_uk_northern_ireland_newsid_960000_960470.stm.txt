Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has rounded on party dissidents calling on him to leave Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive. 

Addressing his party's annual conference at Belfast's Waterfront Hall, Mr Trimble said he was still committed to Good Friday Agreement, on which the province's devolved government is based.

The First Minister, who is facing a possible policy or leadership challenge at a meeting of the party's 860-member ruling council within weeks, said anti-agreement members of his party were undermining the best chance for peace.

Pre-empting their demands for a return to the party's "no guns, no government" policy, he said "the linkage between decommissioning and devolution" had not been broken and that he expected movement on IRA disarmament before three months. 

Unity call



He said: "I hear loud calls for a change of policy. I'll give those who have been shouting a change of policy:

"Stop undermining the party. Stop undermining the leadership of the party. 



On one hand, we can draw nationalism and
republicanism into a consensus.On the other, we can be governed by London with Dublin interference, deprived of a voice, deprived of a veto

"Stop undermining democratic decisions made by your party. Stop running to the media and badmouthing the assembly team."

He asked members: "Will we sleep any sounder in our beds if we are seen to ditch this
agreement? Will there be decommissioning? Will the Union be guaranteed? No, no and no again.

"We will be more successful if we are united with a more mature approach," he argued.


"That is why I won't be walking away from the executive just yet. A
considered and calibrated approach if others do meet their commitments will be better."

Calling on the party to "respect the mandate from the Ulster Unionist Council" he said: "You didn't elect me to go down that path and I won't go down that path."



The choice was "simple," he said.

"On the one hand, we can draw nationalism and
republicanism into a consensus.


"On the other, we can be governed by London with Dublin interference,
deprived of a voice, deprived of a veto."



North-south co-operation doubt 



However, Mr Trimble indicated he may be prepared to step back from full co-operation with the North-South Ministerial Council set up under the agreement.

"We are looking carefully at each aspect of our participation under the agreement," he said.



In February, we proved there was a bottom line. It hasn't changed. 
We remain committed to pushing all paramilitaries to deliver the peace they promised

"Hitherto we have worked pro-actively in the North South Council. I see that being more problematic now."



Mr Trimble warned the IRA against trying to "bluff" their way through the disarmament process, in which he said they had not lived up to commitments made in May.

Referring to the suspension of the assembly in February in the face of Ulster Unionist concern over decommissioning, he told the conference: "They thought they could bluff their way in January.


"In February, we proved there was a bottom line. It hasn't changed. 

"We remain
committed to pushing all paramilitaries to deliver the peace they promised."
The prospect of partnership government, he added, was being "poisoned" by the policing issue and in particular nationalist demands for implementation of the "shoddy" Patten report, which he said was "not acceptable to the whole community". 

Mr Trimble received a standing ovation after his speech, but boos filtered through the applause.

Donaldson critical



Earlier, there were angry exchanges after Fermanagh South Tyrone MP Ken Maginnis was boo-ed and heckled as he criticised anti-agreement unionists.

In his speech, Mr Maginnis issued a thinly-veiled attack on dissident MP Jeffrey Donaldson.





The tight stage management of the conference by the party leadership had left little opportunity in the one hour debate on policy for anti-agreement dissent to be heard.



 But after the conference Lagan Valley MP Mr Donaldson said he was "not impressed" with Mr Trimble's speech.



"I don't think David Trimble went nearly far enough to address the concerns of ordinary unionists," he said.



Predicting that the Ulster Unionists would not be in government with Sinn Fein by Christmas if the IRA did not disarm, he added:                             "We haven't heard what our party is going to do to press for decommissioning."

Mr Donaldson has made no secret of his future leadership ambitions, but the UUP dissidents are expected to hold fire until the next Ulster Unionist Council meeting.



Reacting to Mr Trimble's speech, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said the UUP leader's difficulties had arisen from "his own at times ambivalent leadership".                                        



Speaking at a party meeting in Dublin, he said: "The IRA were not prepared under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement to hand over their guns.       



"But the IRA have taken initiatives to ensure the peace process has survived crises created by unionism."



Meanwhile, on Monday the assembly is to debate a motion of no confidence in Mr Trimble as first minister, tabled by the anti-agreement Democratic Unionist Party.

The motion is unlikely to be passed.
