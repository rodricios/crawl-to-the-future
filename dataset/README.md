Datasets - websites from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015
-----------------------------------------------------

This directory is where you'll find an on-going accumulation of
websites from the following domains:

* NYTimes - started
* Reuters - started
* CNN - started
* Fox News
* MSNBC
* Yahoo News
* Forbes
* The Atlantic
* The New Yorker
* The Nation
* more domains yet to be listed

Dataset Composition
-------------------

Each one of the above sources will exist in their own directory.

Currently, the only requirement is that each source's downloaded
html's live in its own directory. This is automatically satisfied
in [waybacktrack.py](../crawlers/Way-Back#waybacktrack)

Most likely in future updates, I will include automated process
of creating subdirectories depending on the year of the archive.
