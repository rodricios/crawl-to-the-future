dataset a.k.a. websites from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015
=======================================================

This directory is where you'll find a in-progress accumulation of
websites from the following domains:

In an email with Tim Weninger, Tim asked this:

> Can you think of a way to get 10 random nytimes articles from each time period, 10 reuters articles, 10 cnn articles, etc for 10-20 sources?

---

This means that in the subdirectories, you'll find a test set of web pages from the following places:

* NYTimes
* Reuters
* CNN
* etc.*

*note: oh god, this means we'll probably have to include Fox News in there too, and 6 to 16 more sources

Here's some more sources that I'll to gather webpages from:

* Fox News
* MSNBC
* Yahoo News
* Forbes
* The Atlantic
* The New Yorker
* The Nation

Dataset Composition
-------------------

Each one of the above sources will exist in their own directory, and each one of those directories, there will be at most two subdirectories:

    One for crawled/download html
    One for hand downloaded html

Most likely, you'll only find **crawled** downloaded webpages, b/c hand downloading is a pain.
