<p><a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lqg0K"><strong>David Hood</strong></a> received a string of &ldquo;real winners&rdquo; all from the same nursing-home employer. He wrote:</p><ul> <li>One year each person got a ham. I don't eat meat and many of my co-workers were Jewish.</li> <li>I got a company sweatshirt mailed to my house that was four sizes too big and one arm was longer than the other by six inches or so.</li> <li>A letter of thanks directly from my boss. He got my name wrong even though I had been there for years and it was a small staff. It wasn't a typo either as he referred to me as "Danny" twice in the same letter.</li> <li>A coupon to eat a free meal at the nursing home I worked at...as a cook. They didn't charge for staff meals either.</li> <li>An envelope full of pamphlets on how to lose weight with no letter or explanation.</li> <li>A gas card for 15 bucks from a place that had been closed for nearly six months.&nbsp;</li> </ul><p><strong>Outright cheap</strong></p><p>Worse, perhaps, is when an employer appears to be presenting a monetary gift, but delivers something different altogether. Imagine <a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lqJxk"><strong>Jay Bazzinoti&rsquo;s</strong></a> excitement one Christmas when he received a sealed envelope from human resources with the words &ldquo;Company Incentive Bonus&rdquo; and &ldquo;We Appreciate Your Hard Work&rdquo; written on it.</p><p>To his horror, the envelope was full of coupons. &ldquo;To make matters worse, since the company was bi-coastal, the envelope was stuffed in California and most of the coupons were useless in Boston,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;It made me rather bitter. I tossed it right in the trash, laughing at my naive belief that the company might actually do something human and unexpected in a way that actually benefitted the employees.&rdquo;</p><p>Similarly, <a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lqcdm"><strong>Andy Warwick</strong></a>, who wrote his company&rsquo;s English courses, felt disbelief when he received his holiday bonus: a 20% discount on the company's English courses for his kids.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have kids,&rdquo; Warwick wrote. &ldquo;[This was] a nice offer for the Chinese staff perhaps but not so much for the likes of me.&rdquo; [Warwick has since deleted his post.]</p><p>Postal workers in the UK have been equally miffed. &ldquo;Royal Mail celebrated record &pound;100m ($156.6m) profits by sending all its employees a magnificent bonus&hellip;a packet of flower seeds,&rdquo; wrote <a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lq9pH"><strong>Joe Geronimo Martinez</strong></a>. &ldquo;This &lsquo;gift&rsquo; retailed at around 30p (45 cents).&rdquo;</p><p>And in Singapore, <a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lqVOz"><strong>Marissa Louise</strong></a> once received a bonus of an ez-link card for public transportation with &ldquo;a $3 (yes....THREE) balance, designed by the boss' 7-year-old daughter,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;We are all either Singapore citizens, permanent residents or long-term pass holders for God&rsquo;s sake, not a one-day tourist.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Takes the cake</strong></p><p>From burritos, to pistachios, candy bars and fruit cake, respondents said they&rsquo;ve received it all in the name of a holiday bonus. Some items, though, have been appreciated more than others.</p><p><a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lqlMS"><strong>Corrie Hausman</strong></a>, now a HR specialist and recruiter, recalls a trying retail job where she worked long hours, had few breaks and dealt with grumpy customers. &ldquo;Amazingly, though, we got a Christmas bonus!,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;A box arrived from the head office. It contained some cookies (six in total) which were to be shared amongst a staff of about 25, a catalogue listing all the cookies we hadn't received and a letter from the head office, telling us all to work harder. The best part? All six cookies had been smashed to bits in transit.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lqxwt"><strong>Dana Poncelet&rsquo;s</strong></a> bonus of a turkey and a box of oranges was initially welcomed. Then they &ldquo;were subsequently declared as taxable income on my paycheque.&rdquo;</p><p>At least she got a turkey. <a href="/web/20150105212223/http://qr.ae/lqjbQ"><strong>Steve Johnson</strong></a>, a federal contractor on a military base, received a turkey for 15 years, a tradition that survived three different contractors.</p><p>&ldquo;Then the cheapest company on earth&hellip;got the contract,&rdquo; Johnson wrote. &ldquo;For Christmas that first year, they ACTUALLY, honest-to-God gave the employees a photocopy of a turkey silhouette. It wasn't even a copy of a real turkey. It looked like the turkeys your kids make out of their handprints in kindergarten, except it wasn't even in colour. Just a black and white silhouette of a turkey. Several of them were taped to headquarters' front door in the days following.&rdquo;</p><p>The kicker? &ldquo;The next year, we didn't even get a copy of a turkey,&rdquo; he wrote.</p><p><em>Have you ever gotten a bad bonus?
