celebrate </dt> <dd>  <p>The festive season is a time to get away for many people. </p>

<p>Yet not everyone takes a quick trip by car to the in-laws’s house. The wealthiest among us often rev up the engines on their private planes and take off somewhere luxurious — and often out of reach to the rest of us. </p>

<p>Where do the rich like to go to celebrate year-end holidays? Scroll through the images above to get a glimpse of six favourites. (Black Tomato)</p>  </dd> </dl> </li>  <li class="item-1">  <img src="/web/20150101120915im_/http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2f/rm/p02frmtj.jpg" width="624" height="351" />  <dl class="item-caption item-1"> <dt> The Maldives </dt> <dd>  <p>With its still water, turquoise lagoons, white sand beaches and high level of service, the Maldives — an archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean — checks all the boxes for paradise. Here, the rich have access to some of the most fascinating rooms available anywhere in the world, such as the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island Hotel’s glassed-in underwater suite that starts around $10,000 per night.</p>

<p>There’s no limit to luxury in the Maldives, which makes it one of the most special places to celebrate. Private yachts, submarines, islands, underwater clubs — it’s all available for a price. Chartering a private yacht for the week runs around $14,000.  </p>

<p>Many of the greatest and most impressive innovations in hotel amenities and offerings are happening in the Maldives, says Tom Marchant, cofounder of travel agency Black Tomato based in London and New York City which specialises in luxury bespoke holidays. Take Velaa Private Island, for example, where for about $23,000 per night you can stay in a 1,349 square-meter home on the private island with its own Michelin-starred chef and submarine for outings. When the hotels are always trying to one-up each other the guest gets the very best. Guests pay a lot — and they also get a lot. For example, most everywhere a personal butler is a given.</p>

<p><strong>Who loves it</strong>
Many people end up returning. The picture-perfect setting wins them over immediately, but it’s really the exceptional service that pulls them in, Marchant says. “People there really understand what luxury and service are and look after guests in the best possible way,” he said. The Maldives are fit for royalty, too, as Prince William and Kate Middleton stayed at the five-star Cheval Blanc Randheli earlier in 2014.

<p>“It’s the world's highest-end all-inclusive property in my opinion,” said Stacy Small, president of Los Angeles-based Elite Travel International in an email. And it comes with a high-end price — rates are $4,200 per night.</p>

<p>Holidays here can be celebrated with local flavour, including with a traditional Fijian barbecue and ceremony in the island’s cultural village. Guests also can hide away in their villas with private chefs (one of the many all-inclusive perks) who prepare fresh, impressive meals with ingredients sourced right from the island.</p>

<p><strong>Who loves it</strong></p>

<p>Scion Malcolm Forbes once owned the island. Red Bull cofounder Dietrich Mateschitz bought it and transformed it into its new status of private holiday paradise. International billionaires looking to get away from it all fill the bookings, and it is also popular with well-healed, multi-generational families spending the holidays together, Small says. (Laucala Island)</p>  </dd> </dl> </li>  <li class="item-3">  <img src="/web/20150101120915im_/http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2f/rj/p02frjfv.jpg" width="624" height="351" />  <dl class="item-caption item-3"> <dt> Saint Barthelemey </dt> <dd>  <p>This Caribbean island, affectionately shortened to St. Barts or St. Barths by regulars, is one of the hardest to reach: Private jet or yacht is how most arrive. It is also conspicuously devoid of the big-name chain hotels and all-inclusive resorts that line the beaches of most of its island neighbours. Around Christmas, the high-end properties — that’s all there is here — including boutique hotels and villas book up well in advance of the season, Small says. Many villa properties cost $100,000 to $200,000 to rent for the week.</p>

<p>The island feels like France in a Caribbean wrapper, particularly the culinary scene, which consists of numerous French restaurants helmed by top French chefs like Restaurant Le Gaïac at five-star Hotel Le Toiny. </p>

<p>“The dining scene alone is reason to book a holiday trip,” said Small. But it’s still island living: even at the most elite restaurants, many of which host special meals and events at this time of year, no ties are required. </p>

<p><strong>Who loves it</strong></p>

<p>Since the 1950s St Barth’s has been the place to be and be seen for A-list celebrities and their cohorts, and every year at the holidays this privileged class religiously migrate here, keeping up the island’s elite buzz. Despite an occasional photograph surfacing of them out and about on the island, it is considered one of the most protected from paparazzi of all the favourite and frequented celebrity escapes. This crowd appreciates that privacy, according to Small. (Marcel Mochet/AFP/Getty Images)</p>  </dd> </dl> </li>  <li class="item-4">  <img src="/web/20150101120915im_/http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2f/rj/p02frjnl.jpg" width="624" height="351" />  <dl class="item-caption item-4"> <dt> South Africa </dt> <dd>  <p>South Africa, particularly around Cape Town and the Eastern Cape, has a little bit of everything for its wealthy visitors. There is a world-class wine and gastronomy scene, a cosmopolitan city, outdoor safari experiences and gorgeous beaches, as well as a high level of service and hospitality, Marchant says. </p>

<p>And this time of year, summer in the Southern Hemisphere, the weather is dreamy with days around 25°C and nights cooling to 15°C. </p>

<p>Favoured deluxe accommodations run the gamut from luxury residence-turned-hotel Ellerman House in Cape Town with sweeping views of the city to escaping to a private game reserve to slumber, like Tswalu Kalahari Private Game Reserve, which has family suite rates upwards of $2,500 per night. </p>

<p>A trip up to Cape Town’s iconic Table Mountain, with panoramic views of the city and its environs every way you turn is a unique New Year’s Eve experience. Those with the means opt for private tours and concierges to organise the outing, with extras catering to their hearts’ desires like a private chef for an outdoor dinner.</p>

<p><strong>Who loves it</strong></p>

<p>For many visitors, once they celebrate New Year’s Eve in South Africa, they return year after year, Marchant says. They form networks and friendships and all return to the same parties from different corners across the globe. Groups of friends or families often rent a home lining one of the bays, which usually start around $5,000 per week — but also can cost that per night, depending on where you stay. (Black Tomato)</p>  </dd> </dl> </li>  <li class="item-5">  <img src="/web/20150101120915im_/http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2f/rk/p02frkn3.jpg" width="624" height="351" />  <dl class="item-caption item-5"> <dt> Maui, Hawaii </dt> <dd>  <p>The Hawaiian island Maui has a lot going for it: perfect beaches, luxurious hotels, professional-standard golf courses, always-pleasing weather, and top restaurants. Plus, the laid-back and relaxed atmosphere makes it truly feel like an escape. </p>

<p>“There is a vibe on Maui you feel the minute you get off the plane that doesn’t exist elsewhere,” Small said.</p>

<p>Since Maui gets crowded at the holiday season, particularly around the Kaanapali area where many of the well-trodden chain hotels are located, it might not seem so exclusive. But the wealthy head to other parts of the island for luxury and serenity, to places such as the Four Seasons at Wailea where a two-bedroom suite costs more than $5,000 per night around the December holidays. One must-go place for those in the know is the private Lahaina Yacht Club, where you either have to be a member or be invited by a member to enter.</p>

<p><strong>Who loves it</strong></p>

<p>Maui is a celebrity favourite with actors and professional golfers who hit the links at famed Kapalua Golf’s Plantation Course with rates around $300 per person. (The nearby Montage Kapalua Bay opened a few months ago and already has established itself as favoured lodging for the jet set; a two-bedroom suite this time of year is about $3,000 a night.) Maui also is especially popular with US West Coasters and wealthy Canadians. The island is a playground for amateur and professional athletes, who spend their days surfing, hiking, paddle boarding, boating, doing yoga or swimming, with private trainers at the ready.

His clients, who generally come to him looking for a tailor-made holiday that pulls out all the stops also includes adventure and culture, continue to return to see and do more, from exclusive excursions like outings to thermal hot springs, dog sledding and scuba diving between tectonic plates and then also spending time in the country’s capitol city. </p>

<p>Iceland also offers the opportunity for outdoor winter sports galore, including heli-skiing, a top sport for many rich adrenaline junkies, for which a luxury tour package can cost in the area of $30,000. </p>

<p>“There’s such wonderful natural phenomenon here,” Marchant said. “And then there’s a sense of style and the discerning attitude of Reykjavic.”</p>

<p>This time of year the Northern Lights dance across the sky, and this is one of the best places to see them. Those who want to make the experience extra special go through concierges or tour companies to charter a yacht to see them from the water, head out on snowmobiles or a private husky sled tour. Luxury rural resort Hotel Rangá bills itself as the spot to stay to catch the lights, and a suite runs slightly less than $1,000 per night. </p>

<p><strong>Who loves it</strong></p>

<p>The country’s positioning in the middle of the Atlantic makes it easy to access from both sides of the pond for the holidays. It also has a certain elite coolness that has made Iceland trendy and buzzy while still unassuming. Case in point: There are a number of impressive design-savvy hotels like the luxury boutique 101 Hotel Reykjavik, though the country’s first five-star digs are currently under construction. And it’s particularly popular with world-famous musicians and artists, Marchant said, which adds to the country’s already-vibrant cultural scene. With places like The Grillmarket in Reykjavic, which offers a multi-course tasting menu with wine pairings (about $140/person), the gastronomy also doesn’t disappoint.
