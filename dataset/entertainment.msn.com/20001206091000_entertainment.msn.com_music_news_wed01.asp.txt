 
Limp Bizkit hit yet another snag in their beleaguered Anger Management Tour when the group was forced to cancel Sunday night's show at San Diego's Sports arena only hours before the show was to begin. Frontman Fred Durst's continuing throat problems were cited as the official reason for the cancellation. 
 
San Diego, Calif., radio station KIOZ FM, which had given away tickets to contest winners, posted news that "The boys have bailed on San Diego. Reports of a sore throat have canceled the Sunday show at Sports Arena. If you bought tickets they are refundable. If you won them you can use them to wipe with. We're sorry, we wish we could do more." 
 
"The switchboard was lit up all night with angry fans," claimed Dana Chavarria, a producer for the KIOZ. "Some people actually drove down there and found out only then there was no show, and they were pissed." 
 
Despite the tardiness of the cancellation, a source from the tour's promoter, SFX, claimed that it wasn't a last minute decision to stop the show; doctors were summoned following Limp Bizkit's show at the Forum in Los Angeles on Friday night, and they determined that he would not be able to perform on Sunday night. "We canceled the show first thing on Saturday, but given that it was Thanksgiving weekend, we had a hard time spreading the word," an SFX spokesperson said. Limp Bizkit is due in San Antonio, Tex., on Nov. 29, but according to SFX, that date is still on hold. "We're not sure of Fred's condition yet, and if he'll be able to perform." The promoter also said that there are no plans as yet to reschedule the San Diego show. "We just have the word that it's canceled." 
 
The San Diego cancellation marks the fifth time that the band has pulled out of a show since the Anger Management tour kick-off on Oct. 19 at the Continental Airline Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. The tour was initially derailed when a Massachusetts doctor diagnosed Durst's persistent throat problems as acute laryngeal edema, or swollen vocal chords, after he complained of a sore throat during the band's Worchester, Mass., show on Oct. 23. Durst was forced to take a sick day, canceling the band's appearance at Albany, N.Y.'s Pepsi Arena on Oct. 24. His ongoing problems also caused cancellations of shows in Indianapolis, Ind., Vancouver, B.C. and San Jose, Calif. 
 
Limp Bizkit's label insists there are no plans to stop the tour, and claims they are in the process of trying to schedule make-up dates for the missed shows. A label spokesperson explained that Durst has had little chance to recover from his throat problems due to the band's grueling tour schedule. The tour is scheduled to conclude on Dec. 19 in Durst's hometown of Jacksonville, Fla., after which the band will take three weeks off before heading to Japan on Jan. 11.
