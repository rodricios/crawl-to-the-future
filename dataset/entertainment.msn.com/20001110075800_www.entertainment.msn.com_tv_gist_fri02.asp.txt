Tiffani Thiessen has a new gig. The former Beverly Hills, 90210 regular has signed up to star in an ABC pilot tentatively called Something About Tiffani, says Variety. Thiessen will play a beer-swilling, sharp-tongued woman who leaves her fiancé at the altar, goes to Italy for six months and returns home minus 70 pounds. Her three male college friends/housemates, who'd always thought of her as just one of guys, are blown away by her new sexy appearance. 
 
"They're expecting the old Tiffani, and this hot babe walks in," said Mark Blutman, who will create, write and executive-produce the pilot with Howard Busgang. "Inside, she's still one of the guys: She's salty, she's ballsy. The dynamics of the house are thrown completely off the chart." 
 
The show is penciled in on the network's fall 2001 schedule. 
 
In addition to 90210, Thiessen's résumé includes the ABC sitcom Two Guys and a Girl, NBC's Saturday morning teen comedy Saved by the Bell and a number of TV movies. Jenny Higgons, Gist TV Staff
