A rumpled and engaging Michael Douglas stars in Curtis Hanson's hilarious, moving, beautifully crafted adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel. With greasy hair and two-day stubble, Douglas is Grady Tripp, an aging wunderkindhis first novel was hailed as a masterpiecewho is hiding out from the world as a professor of creative writing at a Philadelphia university. The film follows Grady over the course of a long weekend, during which he is dumped by his wife, informed by his mistress (and boss, played by Frances McDormand) that she's pregnant, visited by his drug-addled New York agent (Robert Downey Jr.), propositioned by his student boarder (Katie Holmes) and deeply impressed by the work of the class misfit (Tobey Maguire).



Without a single, strong narrative thread to see him through, Hanson ("L.A. Confidential") has to rely on intangibles like rhythm, texture and character development to hold his film together; he does it in a high, classical style, worthy of one of the best studio directors of the '40s or '50s. The mastery of detail is stunning, as Hanson wrests more emotional resonance from a slice of soggy pizza than most filmmakers can find in an entire performance. Numbed by the marijuana he smokes compulsively but drawn into life by the infinite, nagging problems he creates for himself, Grady is a man between. He's unable to choose among all the options that stand before him, yet he's painfully aware that those options are dwindling. This could be the best film about middle age ever made, but keep it to yourselfcan there be any better recipe for box-office disaster?
