I've already gotten all I really wanted for Christmas: a new "Harry Potter" movie, followed by an unexpectedly good  on-screen version of "Chronicles of Narnia." 

And that's saying something. 

Those nutty Grinches in Hollywood keep ruining perfectly good books --  the Grinch itself, even -- with lame on-screen adaptations. Or worse, they  put stupid tween-targeted books on the big screen and call it a good idea. "Princess Diaries," anyone? Gag me with a tiara. 

So now that the year's best movies for tweens are behind us, how are  thoughtful tweens of all ages supposed to pass their free time? 

With other great book-and-movie combinations, of course.  

There are smart alternatives for every sort of kid. Here are our top 10  picks, in no particular order.
