 You'd think it would be anything goes on MTV. But the network has deemed a Candie's shoe commercial too sexy and banned it from airing before 9 p.m. ET, according to the New York Post. 
 
The 60-second spot features Sugar Ray lead singer Mark McGrath and Nash Bridges star Jodi O'Keefe in a steamy shower scene. 
 
As the spot begins, McGrath is shown taking off a towel and stepping into the shower. Then O'Keefe joins him, and the two passionately kiss. 
 
The camera then focuses on their shadows, which clearly indicate the pair are having sex. 
 
A spokesperson for Candie's tells the Post there isn't anything wrong with the commercial, but the company is considering pulling the spot from MTV altogether. 
 
Meanwhile, MTV contends the spot is too risqué to be seen during daytime hours. According to a statement released to the Post by the network, "The premise of a couple enjoying a shower together and the extended depiction of the shower is too provocative for an all-day rotation." 
 
Candie's ads have caused controversy before. Censors were in an uproar over spots featuring Charmed star Alyssa Milano in sexy situations and a print campaign that showed Jenny McCarthy sitting on the toilet. Christine Champagne, Gist TV Staff
