Sorry. We forgot ourselves for a moment and turned into a preteen girl.  Robert Pattinson is, of course, ostensibly an actor, but try telling that to the  hordes of underage girls, overage cougars, and gay men of all ages who have made  him a star. The "Twilight" and "Harry Potter" actor inspires crazed, hormonal  behavior wherever he goes.  

But will audiences be interested if he's not sucking blood or playing  Quidditch? Summit Entertainment is hoping the answer is yes. Despite appearing  in a handful of indies (mostly notably 2008's "Little Ashes," in which he played Salvador Dali),  Pattinson remains relatively untested as a leading man. His drawing power will  be challenged with the release of "Remember Me," a romantic drama about young lovers  working through family tragedy.  

A teen idol's first stab at legitimacy is always perilous. For every Rob Lowe there's a Scott Baio. But Pattinson shouldn't  be too worried. Some of Hollywood's biggest and best actors rose to fame on the  overeager thumping of teenage hearts. In celebration of "Remember Me," here are  12 memorable teen idols. Whether their careers ended up massive successes or  complete failures, they were all totally dreamy.
