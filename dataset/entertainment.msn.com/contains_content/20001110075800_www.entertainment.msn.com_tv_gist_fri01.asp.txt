The Queen of Talk plans to reign through 2004. Reuters reports that Oprah Winfrey has signed on for two more years with Viacom's King World Productions to continue hosting her highly rated syndicated gabfest, The Oprah Winfrey Show. 
 
Apparently, the deal was long in the making. Winfrey never said publicly whether she would renew her contract after her two-year pact ends after the 2001-02 season, and comments she made during a tribute to Roger King, King World's chairman, at the National Association of Television Program Executives led to speculation that she might not renew. But after months of negotiations, Winfrey finally made up her mind. 
 
"We've been talking for months and months, and really it was her decision and we proceeded from there," King said. "But she's very positive about her show. It's very inspirational, it makes lots of money for stations, and it's a great news lead-in. It's great television for the country." 
 
Winfrey added, "I am finally at a point in my life where I'm doing the kind of shows I've always wanted to do, helping people to see themselves more clearly and to make choices that lead to more fulfilled lives." 
 
As part of the deal, King World agreed to work with Winfrey's production company, Harpo, to develop another syndicated show, but no further details have been released. 
 
Now it's King World's turn to shop the 15-year-old show around to individual stations. ABC-owned stations will air Oprah through the 2001-02 season, but there is talk that CBS, also owned by Viacom, may try to scoop it up. Kristen Remeza, Gist TV Staff
