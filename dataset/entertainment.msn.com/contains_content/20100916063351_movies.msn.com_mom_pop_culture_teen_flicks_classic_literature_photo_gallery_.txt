OMG! Romeo is like so totally dreamy!

Your high school valedictorian wasn't as smart as he or she seemed. Instead  of spending endless hours reading seminal literature for English class, they  could've saved valuable partying time by just watching the movie. 

Think of it this way: You could spend the weekend toiling over 300-plus pages  of a book about a pastor searching for his son in Johannesburg. Or, you could  watch James Earl Jones and Richard Harris, two of the greatest actors in  history, tell the same story in 106 minutes. Which is the better way to  experience Alan Paton's "Cry, the Beloved Country?" Probably the former. But  which option allows for more beach time? That's where the Netflix queue comes in  handy. 

But, sometimes, adapting great books for the screen simply isn't enough.  After all, the petticoats of "Pride and Prejudice" have little relevance to  today's teens. And many of our high school graduates would have trouble finding  Denmark on a map. They don't want to spend five acts reading about its moody  prince, unless he's crossing the North Sea for some kind of prince-related  diplomacy with Harry and William. Kids today have enough angst in their lives  without "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" and her letter stuck under the carpet.  

And that's where the modern day revision comes in. Sometimes great, sometimes  terrible, but always accessible, teen movies are constantly reaching back to  English class for their plots whether their audiences know it or not. 

This week marks the release of "Easy A," a comedic twist on Nathaniel Hawthorne's  "The Scarlet Letter." Emma Stone stars as a girl who  pretends to sleep with geeky guys for mutual social advancement. As her bad  reputation grows, wearing a big, red A isn't too far behind. 

In celebration of the film's release, here are ten other teen flicks with  classic lit origins.
