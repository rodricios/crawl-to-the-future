Background
In "The Legend of Bagger Vance," Smith plays the title character, a 
golf caddy in Georgia after World War II. Veteran Rannulph Junah (Matt 
Damon) is directly out of the war and about to enter a high-profile golf tournament. In preparation, Vance helps him deliver "the 
Authentic Swing." Charlize Theron plays the match's promoter with Jack Lemmon as the film's narrator.



Buzz
It's been a while since Smith has done dramatic work like "Six Degrees of Separation." "Bagger Vance" may be the film that
rediscovers his acting talent. Directed by ever-hunky Robert Redford,
the film is based on Steven Pressfield's novel of the same name and borrows its themes from the Bhagavad Gita. (Bagger Vance, Bhagavad. Get it?) Reports say the National Council of Hindu Temples is worried about the ancient text's cinematic interpretation, but, with a powerhouse cast, this shouldn't hurt the film's assured box-office intake.
