 
Trent Reznor could have told Radiohead the ride would be a short one. One year ago, Nine Inch Nails debuted at No. 1 with the weird, sprawling and defiantly non-commercial The Fragile, a work not unlike Radiohead's ambitious, difficult Kid A, which debuted at the top of the SoundScan album charts itself last week with sales of 207,393 copies. And just like The Fragile, Kid A took a tumble its second week, plummeting all the way down to No. 10 with second week sales down to 89,053 copies (Reznor's opus fell to No. 16 in its second week).  
 
With Radiohead (and rock) out of the way, the formidable trio of Ja Rule, Nelly and Mystikal closed ranks to hold down the top three spots in the name of rap. Rule 3:26, Queens, N.Y.-born Ja Rule's follow-up to last year's Venni Vetti Vecci, claimed the No. 1 spot with first week sales of 275,985 copies. Nelly's sixteen-week-old Country Grammar climbed from No. 3 back up to No. 2, trading places with Mystikal's three-week-old Let's Get Ready. Creed's Human Clay bounded all the way from No. 8 back to No. 4, while 98 Degrees stubbornly held onto No. 5 for the second week in a row with Revelation. The Baha Men continue to run wild, jumping up two more spots to No. 7, while Eminem's Marshall Mathers LP fought its way back into the Top 10 after a week's exile, pushing past Radiohead to get to No. 9. Dropping out of the Top 10 after strong debuts last week are Scarface's Last of a Dying Breed (No. 11) and Green Day's Warning (No. 14). 
 
Meanwhile, the Wallflowers pretty much lived up to their name, quietly debuting at No. 13 with sales of 80,818 copies of their third album, Breach. Other debuts include E-40's Loyalty & Betrayal (No. 18), Collective Soul's Blender (No. 22), M.O.P.'s Warriorz (No. 25), Changing Faces' Visit Me (No. 46), Sara Evans' Born to Fly (No. 62), Bette Middler's Bette (No. 69) and Flesh-N-Bone's Fifth Dog Lets Loose (No. 98). 
 
Looking ahead to next week, expect Ja Rule, Nelly and Mystikal to stay strong, but Ja Rule's got another thing coming if he expects to hold on to No. 1 any longer than Radiohead did. Limp Bizkit's coming to town with their new Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, and rest assured Fred Durst has his mind set on breaking some sales records. 
 
This week's Top 10: Ja Rule's Rule 3:36 (275,985 copies sold), Nelly's Country Grammar (150,136), Mystikal's Let's Get Ready (134,210), Creed's Human Clay (120,186), 98 Degrees' Revelation (115,370), Madonna's Music (110,287), Baha Men's Who Let the Dogs Out (100,966), 3 Doors Down's Better Life (94,320), Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP (89,583) and Radiohead's Kid A.
