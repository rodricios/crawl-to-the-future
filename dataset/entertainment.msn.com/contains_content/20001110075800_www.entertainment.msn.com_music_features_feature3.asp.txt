 We joined the vice presidential motorcade on a ninety-degree September morning in Silicon Valley, where a sweating Al Gore headlined a campaign rally at a small suburban park in Sunnyvale, a marathon of hand-shaking, baby-kissing and disciplined salesmanship. A couple of hours later, we were off to Moffett Federal Airfield, an overscaled military base with runways long enough for the space shuttle to land and hangars so big, they seemed a part of some other civilization. Within minutes we were airborne, en route back to Washington. 
  
 Air Force Two bears few traces of luxury or personality. The traveling press sits in the back of the plane. There are twenty roomy seats and electrical outlets for your laptop. In a campaign as insistently on-message as Gore's, it seems only fitting that the first meal served is a bowl of Wheaties. Once the plane hits cruising speed, the Secret Service agents - large, calm guys (and one woman) who really do wear bad suits - take off their jackets. When they brush by you walking down the aisle, their big, black handguns are right at eye level: a strange but somehow comforting sight. The military attache, an attractive Air Force major radiating cheerful authority in her well-pressed uniform, carries a bulky, black nylon briefcase wherever she goes: "the football," which contains the codes for launching nuclear war. 
  
 The campaign staffers sit in the middle of the 
 plane, in seats that face one another around tables. In contrast to the 
 Secret Service agents, they are skinny, wired and young - the smartest 
 kids in your high school class. Gore's best friend and brother-in-law, Frank Hunger, a silvery Southern gent with a handshake like old, good leather, moves easily between the staff area and Gore's private cabin, which is at the front of the plane. It's hard to tell exactly what Hunger does here, other than provide balance: "Everything's just more relaxed when Uncle Frank's around," says one young press aide. 
  
 Two hours after liftoff, a markedly relaxed Al Gore welcomes us into his cabin at the front of the plane. The cabin is hardly lavish. It's outfitted with a fold-out couch, a desk and a couple of swivel chairs. The pared-down informality reflects the mood of the campaign. You get the feeling that a Gore White House will be one endless casual Friday - the kind of place where people come to work in their recreational clothes because they know that's the closest they'll get to actually getting out and having fun. The vice president had been wearing cowboy boots for his public appearances. Now he's traded them in for a pair of quilted slippers - the type you'd buy in a sporting-goods store. Next to the couch sits a bulging Eagle Creek backpack, all straps and buckles.
