The holidays are a time for tradition —           
for family and friends, for sharing, for eggnog, for elves and flying reindeer,           
for songs, for presents and for gathering around the television to watch your           
favorite seasonal specials. We’ve gathered together the classics of new and           
old so that you’ll know when to go out to a festive event and when to stay in,           
roast chestnuts on an open fire and let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

2, 8 to 8:30 p.m. ET)    
Christmas specials scare me silly, especially this one, which has Frosty the       
Snowman on a desperate quest to get to the North Pole before he melts. All along       
the way, the snowman is chased by that creepy magician who wants his magic hat       
back. He couldn't care less that Frosty needs its magic powers to keep from turning       
into a puddle. Jimmy Durante narrates this classic cartoon.Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too (ABC, Sunday, Dec. 3, 7 to 7:30 p.m. ET)    
Even though he sometimes messes things up, Winnie the Pooh means well. It's hard       
to get mad at him because he's so cute with his roly-poly stomach — but       
this time he's really done it. In charge of delivering everyone's Christmas Wish       
List to the North Pole, Pooh accidentally sends it in the wrong direction. But       
all is not lost, as Pooh tries to make amends by playing Santa. As always, the       
gang's all here in this 1991 TV special: Christopher Robin, Piglet, Tigger,       
Kanga and Roo.

Christmas" and "Christmas Time" as well as the modern classics

joined onstage by an orchestra, choir, dancers, rapper Little Bow Wow and Brian

shunned by his truly obnoxious herd just because of his shiny red nose. His      
adventures begin when he runs away and encounters an ostracized elf, misfit      
toys, Yukon Cornelius and the Abominable Snowmonster, and end with Rudolph      
lighting the way for Santa in the midst of a blizzard. This digitally remastered      
version, which premiered last year, restores a duet reprise of "We're a      
Couple of Misfits," as well as the instrumental bridge to "We Are      
Santa's Elves" and some additional narration and short scenes cut after its

profiteer (Paul Frees) and to court a comely teacher (Joan Gardner). Guess who
