       Stevie WonderA legendary singer,        songwriter and all-around musician, Wonder has a string of mega-hits        dating back to the '60s. After a period of relative quiet, a big buzz is        building in anticipation of his new album, "A Time to Love."        WeezerIn the mid-'90s, Weezer's        quirky and endearing alt-pop made geekiness cool, but the humorous        approach didn't obscure their very smart and savvy pop-hook craftsmanship.        They've only gotten better, as you can hear on their new album, "Make        Believe."        Aimee MannAimee Mann first tasted        fame in the '80s pop group 'Til Tuesday, but found her true musical        calling in her solo work, where she has staked a claim as one of modern        pop's finest songwriters. "The Forgotten Arm" is her latest.        Nine Inch NailsTrent Reznor's Nine        Inch Nails are the band most responsible for bringing industrial music to        the masses. NIN's pounding electronic beats and Reznor's dark, brooding        persona are lyrically tempered by a quiet vulnerability. "With Teeth'' is the eagerly        anticipated new album.        Toby KeithA hugely popular        performer, former oil field worker Toby Keith currently has the Midas        touch in contemporary country music, riding a seemingly invincible string        of hits. Keith again shows us how it's done on the new "Honkytonk        University."
