When you 
were a kid, what was your take on heaven and hell? When I was growing 
up, I asked my dad, "Am I going to go to hell if I do this or that?" He was 
like, "Listen, you're not going to go to hell, so, don't worry about it." 
Heaven, I just thought, was a nice place. After I lost my grandparents, I knew 
they were up there. I thought about them having fun and looking down on me. I 
was just hoping I wasn't doing anything they'd think was too silly.As you got older, did you ever do anything bad that made 
you think, Uh-oh, this will get me a one-way ticket to fire-and-brimstone?" 
On occasion, I've done some bad things in my life, so I'd call up my 
father and say, "Dad, am I going to hell?" He'd go, "I told you not to worry 
about it." Sounds like your dad is hardly the devilish 
type.He's a very nice guy. My dad in the movie, Harvey Keitel, is the 
devil, but Harvey plays him as a nice guy--just a guy who has a job to do, 
punishing people who do bad things.It's a bit of a surprise to see Keitel going for laughs 
in an Adam Sandler movie.We just sent him the script, and he called 
and said he'd love to do it. Harvey cares about acting, that's his life. But he 
can be a funny guy, too, and he wanted to show that side of himself. He made me 
laugh every day. Every line he'd say, I laughed.
