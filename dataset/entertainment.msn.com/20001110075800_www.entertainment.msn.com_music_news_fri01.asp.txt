 
Five weeks ago, Zack de la Rocha told RollingStone.com that he was "so humiliated" by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford's actions and arrest at the MTV Video Music Awards that he had to leave the show. Now he feels that it's "necessary" to leave the group altogether." 
 
The band's "decision-making process has completely failed," de la Rocha said Wednesday. "It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal. I am extremely proud of our work, both as activists and musicians, as well as indebted and grateful to every person who has expressed solidarity and shared this incredible experience with us."  
 
Rumors of the band's possible break-up started shortly after Commerford's arrest Sept. 7, and increased when Rage returned to self-management, having fired their management team of six months, G.A.S. Entertainment, just a week later. A spokesperson for Epic Records, the band's label, had no information on whether Rage would continue without de la Rocha, but the singer's departure should not impact the band's live album, which was slated for release Nov. 21 and has since been pushed back to Dec. 5. 
 
De la Rocha began working on his first solo album in New York in April.
