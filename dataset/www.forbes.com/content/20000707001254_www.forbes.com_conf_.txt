ounded in January of 1995, the Forbes Management Conference Group has established itself as the premier producer of unique, peer-driven forums for senior executives.


Not unlike Forbes Magazine, Forbes conferences provide the most thought-provoking business editorial in the marketplace--boldly reviewing management performance and challenging conventional wisdom.  The only difference is our conferences do it by bringing executives face-to-face in an atmosphere of candid and interactive discussion.



Each event is by invitation-only, and includes a content-rich agenda that is chock-full with global business and industry leaders.  Equally as important as the business sessions, are the numerous informal, relationship-building opportunities.  It's these relationships that form the backbone of each event, and insure the dialogue continues throughout the year.
