The B2B horse race is off, and just out of the starting gate are more than 1,000 Web marketplaces that have been announced in the past year or so. On the following pages our editors have conferred with industry experts to come up with a handicapping of B2B companies. The result is 200 of the most promising B2Bs in each of 25 different industries. Each company was judged on its strategy, its execution, its financial staying power and its Web site. Most of the exchanges that made our list are already open for business. A few, however, are little more than bold plans with lots of potential. As older established companies enter the race, it will be increasingly difficult to tell the real B2Bs from the B2B wannabes. Expect this list to change significantly in a year's time. New exchanges will be formed, mergers will combine others and many of the bold announcements we've heard will fail to materialize.



   Business Models Marketplace:  Exchanges, auctions, MROs, and online communities.
   Enabler:  Firm that provides the technology and expertise for creating B2B marketplaces and applications.
   ASP:  Application Service Provider. Companies that run and host software for other companies who access it over the Web.
