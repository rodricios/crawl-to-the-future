Dear Sir:
Regarding the article "Mail.com Shouldn't Stay Master Of Its Domains," June 2, why don't we sick President Clinton's Justice Department on them? 





The Justice Department could declare mail.com a monopoly and split the company's holdings up easily. If it can do it to Microsoft, surely the Department of Justice can do it for the rest us capitalists. 



Haven't you heard? If you don't like the way a company operates, just go to the DOJ. They'll help you.

Dear Sir:
In "Speedy Chips Push The Envelope," June 6, John Dvorak writes: I'm often asked, "Exactly what good are these new higher-speed chips when we don't have the software to utilize the power?" 



You obviously haven't heard of 3D modeling (software such as 3D Studio MAX), where some renders, especially animations, can take days of computing power. One-GHz chips are still far too slow for anything approaching "real time."
