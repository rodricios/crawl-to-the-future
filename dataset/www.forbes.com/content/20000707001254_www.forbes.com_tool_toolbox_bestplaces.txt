This second Forbes look at America's regional economies has more surprises in its top ranks than we expected, given the nation's mature boom. A majority of our top 15 metropolitan areas are new to that select list this year.
That reflects two things: First, that we're focused on dynamism--that is, the degree of change rather than simply the base level of activity (that's a help to smaller metros, which don't have a lot of ballast). Second, that America's rising economic tide incorporates waves and undertows. Any year's measure catches some sectors--and therefore some places--waxing and some waning. Repeaters like Austin and Atlanta are therefore all the more notable.




Each metro is ranked from 1 to 294 in each category. A score of 1 is the best.


Methodology:
Our overall ranking is based on a sum of the rankings within eight separate categories for 294 U.S.
metros. The actual data used to establish these rankings was collected from official sources by the
Milken Institute.
      The first four categories measure overall economic activity and are therefore given twice the weight as
the latter four categories, which reflect activity within important technology sectors that we believe
are the primary drivers of economic growth.
