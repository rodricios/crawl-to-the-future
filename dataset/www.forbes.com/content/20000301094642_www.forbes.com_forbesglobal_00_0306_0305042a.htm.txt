The question isn't whether to privatize the BBC. It's how to do it.


Save the British Broadcasting Corp. From what? Entering its 78th year, the grande dame of public broadcasters faces vigorous competition from commercial radio and TV in the home market yet has retained a 39% television audience share and a 51% chunk of radio listening. Beyond Britain, some  270 million people watch BBC television programs and tune in to the BBC World Service radio network, a byword for incisive, impartial news. 
A drain on Her Majesty's Treasury? Not any more. Thanks to tough cost-cutting over the past seven years by its outgoing director general, Sir John (now Lord) Birt, the Beeb reported an aftertax surplus last year of  $102 million, on revenues of around �billion ($5 billion). So well-regarded by the Brits is the Beeb that even Margaret Thatcher decided to retreat from plans to privatize the service in the late 1980s. 


   Yet for all its outward signs of vitality, the BBC is in real danger of being left behind, marginalized, in the Internet Age. 


   The BBC is, arguably, Britain's best brand, and it's the most underexploited brand. Over the years the British public has financed a vast programming library. It includes some of the wittiest, most intelligent programming content in the English language, from the 1950s Goon Show to the 1980s six-part Brideshead Revisited and The Jewel in the Crown. 


   There are roughly one billion English-speaking people outside Britain. Many would find the BBC's fare highly appealing. Yet BBC Worldwide, the division responsible for licensing BBC content and program-inspired books, magazines and other consumer products around the world, grossed just  $650 million in revenues (and claimed a surplus on those revenues of around  $135 million) in fiscal 1999 (which ended last Mar. 31). By contrast, Sumner Redstone's Viacom International generates over  $3 billion a year outside the U.S. Bigger media companies like Disney, Time Warner and News Corp. do far more. 


   Think of it this way:  Global media companies are creating tens of billions of dollars in stock market capitalization by selling their programming around the world. By failing to exploit the BBC's fare, the BBC is in effect wasting a valuable national asset, on a monumental scale.


   For media organizations in the Internet Age, the name of the game is convergence. This means marrying content to the new digital distribution networks springing up around the world. The distributors need good programs to attract audiences. The content owners gain access to eyeballs, ears and fingertips. Convergence is behind Disney's purchase of the ABC television network, Viacom's planned acquisition of CBS, and the AOL/Time Warner deal. 


   Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul the British love to hate, believes in convergence. Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting satellite service, with  2.6 million digital subscribers, is pushing for links with British Telecom's Cellnet mobile phone operation--and with wireless world-leader Vodafone AirTouch/Mannesmann--to deliver Fox programming (owned by Murdoch's News Corp) to a new generation of wireless handsets. 


   Not to be left behind, AOL Time Warner's AOL Europe division is hoping to firm up arrangements with its allies, Bertelsmann and RTS Wireless, and with the mobile-phone manufacturers Nokia and Ericsson. Soon you'll be able to access AOL Time Warner's CNN on your cell phone, Psion or Palm Pilot. 


   Where's the BBC in all this? It has digital TV channels and some minor licensing deals (for example, with the Public Broadcasting System's Discovery Channel in the U.S.).It also has two satellite stations, BBC Prime and BBC World, which are sold in other  countries. 


   But it is the chance to exploit much more aggressively new digital distribution technology that is going to make the BBC's vast archive of programs a big economic winner. Imagine the possibility of downloading, on a TV set in Singapore or through a wireless handset in Buenos Aires, a showing of I, Claudius or one of John Cleese's Fawlty Towers programs? At will, when you feel like it; with the Beeb raking in a fee, or perhaps sharing in a distribution partner's advertising revenues. Both Gregory Dyke, who became the BBC's director general on Jan. 29, and his predecessor Lord Birt have remarked that real globalization is going to require taking advantage of the new digital TV and Internet distribution technologies.


   But how? Building the BBC's own global digital distribution network at this stage is too expensive. 


    As a public service provider, the BBC receives around 75% of its  $5 billion (revenues) from the license fees of  $163 (�1) per household per year that British households must pay if they want to have a TV set. Currently 21 million British households pay these fees. Last year the Davies Commission, a private-sector committee set up by the government, proposed to increase the license fee by  $38 for every household with a digital TV set (there are currently over 2 million of them). But the extra  $80 million or so won't go very far towards building a global distribution network. The proposal was also politically unpopular.


   In any case, the BBC has other demands on its funds. The cost of popular programs is skyrocketing and not just for highly paid talent. Example:  Murdoch's BSkyB in 1997 agreed to fork over  $1.1 billion for the rights to televise, live, the Premiership soccer matches for four years. The BBC's rather limp response:   $117 million over four years to televise Match of the Week  reruns. 


   Last month, the BBC also lost to Murdoch the BAFTA film awards ceremonies--the British Oscars--having already let Sky make off with the U.K. TV rights to the Hollywood Oscars. In another blow, Channel 4, one of the BBC's commercial TVcompetitors, lifted the TV rights to cricket Test matches from the BBC locker. 


   Since the BBCfinds it hard enough to keep up, it should consider cutting a deal with a digital distributor that's hungry for content--AT&T or Microsoft might be interested. But these days the big media-convergence deals are done with publicly traded stock, with market valuations telling the players what their respective contributions to the pot are worth. Without a publicly traded share, the BBC can't play this game. In a world that's being shaped by creative entrepreneurs wielding equity stakes, the BBC is resolutely state-owned. 


   In the name of leveraging the BBC's great strengths in content creation, isn't it time to rethink the BBC's fundamental structure? Rather than trying to extract more money from the British public, why not tap private investors? In short, has the time come to privatize the BBC? 


   The chaps charged with confronting the P-word are Prime Minister Tony Blair, of course, and Greg Dyke. A well-plugged-in British media executive who's comfortable on both sides of the public/private fence (he worked for years in commercial television, along with Birt and BBC Governor Sir Christopher Bland), the 52-year-old Dyke has several options to  choose from.


   Option One:  Wholesale privatization. Sell the BBC--all of it--to private investors, the way Margaret Thatcher sold British Telecom and other state-owned assets. Full privatization might raise anywhere from  $15 billion to  $35 billion. (We base our notional estimate on revenues of  $5billion to  $9 billion that we reckon the BBC's 23,000 employees could generate under private ownership, taking Disney and Time Warner as guides, and then capitalizing those revenues using Disney's and Time Warner's price/sales ratios). 


   But Option One is not going to happen. There's no political will for outright privatization, and a great many serious and influential people actively oppose it. 


   Gavyn Davies is a Goldman Sachs investment banker who last year headed the commission set up to appraise the BBC's financial needs. "What convinced us that the BBC should remain a public service provider," Davies tells FORBES GLOBAL, "was that we perceive market failure in the media sector in the U.S. and elsewhere. Frankly, that is where Idiffer from many of my American colleagues. And we see the BBC in its present [publicly owned] form as less likely to encounter those problems." Most Brits would agree with that  assessment.


   Option Two:  Let the BBC borrow the capital it needs in the debt markets. Neil Blackley, who specializes in media company research at Merrill Lynch in London, thinks that this option might have a lot of potential.


   Option Three:  Partial privatization--another very promising route. As the chart on page 45shows, the BBC is a kind of government holding company. One of its holdings, BBC Worldwide, could be privatized without affecting the BBC's role as a public service provider of cultural products to British audiences.


   BBC Worldwide is a potential gold mine that would be coveted by private investors. Run by Rupert Gavin, 45, it is Europe's leading exporter of television programs. It also has the worldwide rights outside the U.K. to exploit the BBC's program library--and everywhere to doing licensing deals with makers of toys, games and other consumer products. Gavin is now hard at work building brands, such as Teletubbies dolls, a magazine called Top of the Pops and a series of car, clothing, gardening and antiques books, all tied to popular BBC programs. He says he wants his operation "to be recognized as one of the U.K.'s leading international consumer media companies." 


   What's it worth? In fiscal 2000 BBC Worldwide will gross some  $820 million, and Gavin forecasts revenues of  $2.4 billion by 2006. If he can maintain last year's margins, the business should earn nearly  $500 million by then. Our guess:  a privatized BBC Worldwide would currently be worth as much as   $5 billion. 


   Another possibility:  privatize the BBC's commercial Internet operation, beeb.com, which sells BBC licensed merchandise. (BBC Online, at bbc.co.uk, is the main site, providing news, programming schedules and other information.) During the past few years, Lord Birt invested around  $400 million in digitalization, including building the BBC's websites. He may have been thinking of eventually privatizing beeb.com. 


   "Birt very cleverly set up beeb.com, thus laying the groundwork for a commercial Internet vehicle for BBC's online content," says Blackley, adding:  "In IPO terms, it might be more attractive to merge [beeb.com] into BBC Worldwide, but at any rate an Internet facet certainly adds to the attractiveness of any share in today's market." In an IPO, a stand-alone beeb.com might be valued at   $2 billion, especially if it were given access to the BBC's program library.


   Would there be political support for privatizing BBC Worldwide and/or beeb .com? There might well be. 


   In his report last year, Gavyn Davies recommended "an input of private capital of up to 49% of BBC Worldwide's shares. That would involve private capital having seats on the board [and] a voice in policy and management." He also recommended full privatization of BBC Resources, the BBC's technical arm, responsible for filming, taping and editing the BBC's programs. "I'm afraid neither of those recommendations has been greeted with much enthusiasm," Davies says. But the fact that his commission dared to table the ideas suggests that political support for limited privatization is already building. 


   And well it should. Keeping the  program-producing side of the Beeb public while privatizing some of its underlying pieces would give the BBC badly needed capital to defray soaring programming and distribution costs without raising the licence fee. Moreover, a publicly traded stock would give the BBC a currency with which to make deals to secure space on other media companies' distribution platforms. Yet another benefit:  with stock (and, presumably, stock options), the BBC could better reward key managerial talent--putting it on a more equal footing with News Corp., AOL Time Warner and the other private media outfits in the escalating wars for top talent.


   The mandarins in charge of the BBC's future appear to be at sixes-and-sevens over the P-word. When we first spoke to him late last year, Chris Smith, the culture secretary, told us that there's "no chance" of privatizing the BBC, not even pieces of it. But when we spoke to Smith again in mid-February, he backed off that categorical rejection. "The secretary has certainly not eliminated privatization as a possibility," harrumphed a spokesperson, adding that Smith will address the issue publicly soon, probably in March.


   For his part, Dyke is keeping an open mind. A seasoned media man with sound entrepreneurial instincts (having done very well at commercial TV's Granada Group, his net worth is reliably estimated at  $32 million), Dyke understands that when things are moving fast, standing still is the best way to get run over. He promises to continue his predecessor's cost cutting and to spend the savings on programming. Birt trimmed the payroll by 4,000 during his seven-year tenure, but Dyke thinks there's plenty of fat left to cut, especially among the ranks of outside consultants and managers. 


   To date, Dyke has granted only one interview, to the BBC's own David Frost. No questions about privatizing the BBC were asked. But a reliable FORBES GLOBAL source recently attended a dinner party with Dyke. "Everything is on the agenda, when it comes to meeting our [capital-raising] needs," Dyke told his dinner companions. He went on to say that he feels partial privatizations to be both inevitable and desirable. He mentioned BBC Worldwide and beeb.com, the Internet site, as the most obvious  candidates. 


   Dyke, in short, looks like a good bet to push the Beeb forcefully, and profitably, into the Internet Age.
