Billionaires 
By Lisa DiCarlo
What a roller coaster of a year! Gates is still the richest but his fortune was sliced by a third. Poor guy. Wall Street changed its tune about dot-coms--turns out profits do matter--and many millions were lost in the process. Now it's all about global expansion, as companies look to seed fertile, particularly technology-related, markets outside U.S. borders.


This year's database contains 308 billionaires totaling $1.27 trillion in
wealth. Only the top 51 of the richest working Americans are listed. (We will publish the full American list in September in the annual Forbes 400.) Notice a continent missing? No one from Antartica has ever made the list.
