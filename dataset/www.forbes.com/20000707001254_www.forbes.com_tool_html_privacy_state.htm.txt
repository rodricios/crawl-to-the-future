If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to contact us by e-mail at privacy@forbes.com.



Forbes.com does not collect personally identifying information about any individual Forbes.com Web site user except when knowingly provided by such individual. For example, we may ask you for information when you register for a contest or survey or to receive a newsletter. You always have the option not to provide the information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Forbes.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services. 



A cookie is a data file that certain Web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited. Forbes.com uses cookies solely to track user traffic patterns throughout the Forbes.com Web site. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user. 



Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our Web site, you may not be able to use certain features of the site.


Browser Level Information


Forbes.com Web servers automatically collect information about a site user's IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this information from the user's browser (information provided by every user's browser).  This information is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our Web site. This information is automatically logged by most Web sites.



Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our Web site. We achieve this goal by, among other things, providing interactive communications such as our electronic newsletters to the e-mail address that you provide to us, and developing future editorial content based on your interests. To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our Web site users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall. 



Forbes.com is a free Web site and we derive revenues from advertising.  In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. This is essential to keeping our service free of charge to our users. We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.



Forbes.com may also disclose information about our users when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required by law. 



When you are on an area of Forbes.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Forbes.com as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Forbes.com.  If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service. These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies.



In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided directly to advertisers.



Please be aware that Forbes.com sponsors, advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those parties and Web sites linked to Forbes.com are not covered by this privacy statement. Forbes.com users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.



Kids under 13:  Do not send any information about yourself to us--including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.  In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.



If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to contact us by e-mail at privacy@forbes.com.  



This statement may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
