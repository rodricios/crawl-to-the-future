Your continued use of the MSN Web Sites after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to such changes. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><strong>3. ADDITIONAL TERMS </strong></font></p><p><font face="Arial">Any MSN Web Site may itself contain additional terms (for example, codes of conduct or guidelines) that further govern use of that MSN Web Site, including without limitation, particular features or offers (for example, sweepstakes). If any terms contained in this Agreement conflict with any terms contained within a MSN Web Site, then the terms in this Agreement shall control. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><strong>4.

A breach of any part of the Anti-Spam Policy is a breach of this Agreement. Microsoft may use filtering technology or other measures in its efforts to stop unsolicited bulk e-mail and unsolicited commercial e-mail, and if your use of the MSN Web Sites includes e-mail related services, then such filtering technology or other measures may block, either temporarily or permanently, some e-mail sent to you through the MSN Web Sites even if such e-mail does not violate the Anti-Spam Policy. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><strong>6.
