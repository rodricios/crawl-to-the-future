MIAMI BEACH, Fla. – Imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery for Jessica Alba.

The actress said Saturday she's been distressed by Internet reports about a Chinese woman who is having a plastic surgery makeover to look like Alba in hopes of getting her lover back.

"I think you should never have to change yourself like that," Alba said. "If somebody loves you, they'll love you no matter what."

Alba, who is starring in the upcoming film "Valentine's Day," is in town for the Super Bowl; she was at an Audi party Friday with Hilary Swank, Taylor Lautner, Rob Lowe, New York Giant Osi Umenyiora and former New England Patriot Tedy Bruschi. It was one of numerous celebrity soirees attached to the Super Bowl.

But she's not just in town to party — she and hubby Cash Warren will be at Sunday's game. They hired a baby sitter to take care of their infant daughter, Honor, for the big game, but they've been spending the week enjoying Miami with their little girl.

"So far, she likes all the lights. Every time somebody honks or she hears sirens or something, she points everything out," she said. "It's really fun. Lots of screaming, lots of lights, and lots of cars. The most stimulating environment for a 19-month-old."
