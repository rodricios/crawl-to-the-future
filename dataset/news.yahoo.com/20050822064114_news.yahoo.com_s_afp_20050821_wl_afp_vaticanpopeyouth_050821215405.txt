COLOGNE, Germany (AFP) - 


Pope Benedict XVI issued a ringing back-to-basics call to more than one million young Catholics at a giant open air mass which marked a triumphant finale to his first foreign visit as pope.




Wrapping up a four-day visit to his native Germany, the 78-year-old pontiff said young people should turn their backs on secularism and faddish new-age religions.


He said there was "a kind of new explosion of religion" that if pushed too far, turned faith into "almost a consumer product."


The huge open-air mass was the culmination of a visit which swung between the spiritual and the political as Benedict made important progress to fulfilling his pledge to build "bridges of friendship" with other faiths. He visited both Cologne's synagogue, where he condemned the "unimaginable crime" of the Holocaust, and a mosque.


Benedict returned to his summer residence at Castelgandolfo near Rome late on Sunday. During his two-hour flight home his Lufthansa plane flew at low altitude over the pope's native village of Markt am Inn in Bavaria, which lay on a special display of lights and candles so that the pontiff could see it from the air.


Shortly before his departure, the pope had time to lament the "dramatic" shortage of new recruits to the priesthood in his homeland, and urged German bishops to do more to get new vocations.





Outlining the problems facing the Church in his homeland, he said "secularism and de-Christianization" continued to rise, while the "influence of Catholic ethics and morals were in constant decline."



Yet, he warned them there could be "no false compromises, no watering down of Gospel," in efforts to attract young people to the Church.


Earlier Sunday, in a 20-minute homily dominated by a staunch defence of the everyday practice of religion against secularism, the pope warned the multinational crowd of young pilgrims that constructing their faith on a "do-it-yourself" basis would ultimately prove fruitless.


"People choose what they like, and some are even able to make a profit from it. But religion constructed on a 'do-it-yourself' basis cannot ultimately help us."





Many in the huge multi-hued crowd, including Asians and Africans as well as Europeans, Latin Americans and Americans, spent the night at the site where the mass was held, a former coal mine on the outskirts of Cologne.



Some 700,000 had attended a prayer-vigil with Benedict the night before, but the World Youth Day organisers said the numbers had swelled to "more than one million" by Sunday. In addition, 250 million television viewers around the world watched the papal mass, according to Fritz Pleitgen, president of WDR television, which retransmitted the images.


Though shy and retiring, and lacking the forceful personality of his predecessor John Paul II who revelled in such occasions, Benedict appears to have turned a corner in his pontificate and embellished his once rather dry appeal to young people with his first foreign trip.


The young crowd gave Benedict a noisy reception under a huge canopy of swirling flags when he arrived aboard his popemobile, waving and blessing the crowd.


Before beginning the mass, he raised a huge cheer when he said: "I would like to have been able to go through the crowd and greet each and every one of you. That was not possible, but I greet you warmly."


At one point, the pope cajoled them like a grandfather, gently urging them to "make the effort" to attend Sunday mass.


Benedict urged the young Catholics to keep God at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of Sunday mass and receiving Holy Communion.


And the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope's gently-delivered message, which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass.



"He seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected," said George Pierce, 17, from the US state of Pennsylvania.



"Having heard his homily, I have a much better understanding of him and of his past. I feel I have got to know him."
