Researchers in
Switzerland have succeeded in breaking the cosmic speed limit by getting light
to go faster than, well, light.



Or is it all an
illusion?


Scientists have recently succeeded in doing all sorts of
fancy things with light, including slowing
it down and even stopping
it all together. Now a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne
(EPFL) in Switzerland is controlling the speed of light using simple off-the-shelf
optical fibers, without the aid of special media such as cold gases or
crystalline solids like in other experiments.


"This has the
enormous advantage of being a simple, inexpensive procedure that works at any
wavelength," said Luc Thvenaz, lead author of the study detailing the
research.


Using a technique
called Stimulated Brillouin Scattering, the researchers were able to slow down
or ratchet up the speed of light like the gas pedal on a car. They succeeded in
reducing the speed of light by almost a factor of 4 (although that's still
plenty fast at 46,500 miles per second), but even more dramatically, the team
was also able to speed up the speed of light.


Light in a vacuum
travels at approximately 186,000 miles per second, but a popular misconception
is that, according to Einstein's special theory of relativity, nothing in the universe can travel
faster than this speed.


This seeming
paradox can be resolved because a pulse of light is actually made up of many
separate frequency components, each of which moves at their own velocities.
This is known as the pulse's phase velocity. If all the frequency
components have the same phase velocity, then the overall pulse will also
appear to move at that velocity. 


However, if the
components have different phase velocities, then the pulse's overall velocity
will depend on the relationships between the velocities of the separate
components. If the velocities differ, the pulse is said to be moving at the group
velocity.

By
tweaking the relationship between phase velocities, it's possible to adjust the
group velocity and create the illusion that parts of the pulse are traveling
faster than the speed of light.

One area where such an advance could be enormously
beneficial is in the telecommunications industry.


Although information can be channeled through fiber optics
at the speed of light, it can't be processed at this speed because with current
technologies, light signals must be transformed into much slower electrical
signals before they are useful. 


Thevenaz's technique would essentially allow light to be
processed with light without a costly electrical conversion.


The group's
research will be published in an August 22nd issue of the journal Applied
Physics Letters.
