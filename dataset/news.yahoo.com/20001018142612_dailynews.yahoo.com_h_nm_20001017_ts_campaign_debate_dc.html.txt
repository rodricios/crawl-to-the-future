By Alan Elsner, Political CorrespondentST. LOUIS (Reuters) - Democrat Al Gore (news - web sites) went on the
offensive against Republican George W. Bush (news - web sites) in the final debate
on Tuesday, peppering the Texas governor with criticism on
health, education and taxes in a bid to reclaim the initiative
in the presidential race.But saying ``I can get it done,'' Bush accused his Democrat
rival of being a ``big spender'' steeped in the tradition of
Washington's divisive politics.With the presidential race one of the closest in the past
40 years and only three weeks left until Election Day on Nov.
7, both the vice president and the Texas governor were hoping
to woo undecided voters in the 90-minute ``Town Hall Meeting'' at
Washington University.Five of six political analysts interviewed by Reuters
shortly after the debate gave a clear victory to Gore. The
sixth said Gore won on substance but Bush still managed to seem
more likable.``Gore clearly put on the better show while Bush often
seemed fumbling and uncertain,'' said Gary Jacobson of the
University of California, San Diego.But snap polls by two TV networks failed to show a clear
win for the vice president. A CBS poll gave a slight edge to
Gore, 45-40 percent, while ABC poll scored it a tie.CNN said it interviewed viewers who had favored Bush before
the debate 52 to 43 percent. By 46 to 44 percent, they felt
Gore had done a better job on Tuesday night.The pressure was particularly on Gore, who failed to
impress voters in the first two debates and slipped slightly
behind Bush in the polls. Criticized for going too easy on Bush
in the second debate, he came out firing this time, striding
over to Bush and challenging him to define his position on
patients' rights legislation.Bush, who spoke quietly and in measured terms, repeatedly
portrayed himself as a unifier who could work with Republicans
and Democrats to get things done and break the political
gridlock in Washington. But Gore argued the Texan would take
the country back to the past.``If you want someone who believes we were better off eight
years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the
kinds of policies we had back then -- emphasizing tax cuts
mainly for the wealthy -- here is your man, `` Gore said
gesturing toward Bush.``If you want somebody who will fight for you and will fight
to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man. I want to
be,'' Gore said.Bush responded, ``You talk about eight years. In eight years
they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social
Security, a patients' bill of rights. It's time to get
something done.''The latest Reuters/MSNBC poll showed Bush narrowly ahead,
44 percent to 43 percent. Other polls showed Bush with a
slightly larger lead of between two and six points.Only 7 percent of likely voters have said they remained
undecided. Another 17 percent indicated they could change their
minds before Election Day.Betting on voter disdain for the federal government and its
bureaucracies, Bush said the problem on patients' rights and
drugs benefits for senior citizens was political infighting.``There's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C. It's kind
of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue. So what
I want to do is, I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats
to forget all the arguing and finger-pointing and come
together,'' he said.Gore said, ``If you want someone who will spin a lot of
words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up
supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug
companies, this is your man.''``If you want someone who will fight for you and who will
fight for the middle class families and working men and women,
who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents
pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else,
then I want to fight for you,'' Gore said.Unlike the first two debates that had a more formal
setting, the session at Washington University featured an
audience of around 140 undecided voters asking questions.

Gore started off using the entire stage, walking out to the
audience as he gave his responses. Bush spoke directly to the
questioners but stayed back more closely to the stools provided
the candidates.Bush questioned whether Gore was trustworthy enough to be
president and painted him as creature of big government, saying
of the vice president, ``This is a big spender.''Gore stressed the strength of the economy over the past
eight years and told the audience if they supported a ``tax cut
for the wealthy, he's your man.''The exchange on taxes went to the heart of the disagreement
between the two men. Bush said all taxpayers deserved relief.``I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody
ought to get it. And, therefore, wealthy people are going to
get it,'' Bush said.Gore said, ``If everyone here in this audience was dead on
in the middle of the middle class, then the tax cuts for every
single one of you, all added up, would be less than the tax cut
his plan would give to just one member of that top, wealthiest
1 percent. Now, you judge for yourselves whether or not that's
fair.''Bush trumpeted his support for abolishing the Estate Tax,
also known as the ``death tax.''``People shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets. It's
either unfair for some or unfair for all,'' Bush said.Gore said he would eliminate it for most people but not for
the most wealthy -- the ``billionaires.''The meeting began with a moment of silence for Missouri
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, who was killed along with his son
and a campaign aide in an airplane crash on Monday night.The Commission on Presidential Debates said all parties
agreed the debate should go ahead because only three weeks
remained until the election.Bush and Gore, who both expressed condolences to the
Carnahan family, canceled post-debate rallies and Bush asked
the Republican Party (news - web sites) to honor a 48-hour moratorium on political
advertising on television in Missouri.When the subject turned to the violence in the Middle East,
Bush again gave a general response stressing the need for a
clear vision. ``Can't worry about polls or focus groups. Got to
have a clear vision. That's what a leader does,'' he said.Gore listed his years of experience in the House of
Representatives and the Senate on arms control and foreign
policy, as well as his own military service in Vietnam.As the debate approached its end, the subject turned to
affirmative action programs that favor preferential treatment
for minorities in hiring and education. Gore tried to question
Bush directly on his position. Bush refused to respond,
accusing the vice president of breaking the rules of the debate
agreed in advance.One black voter asked Bush about Texas' status as the No. 1
state for executions and questioned whether he took the issue
seriously enough. He said he was not proud of the fact that he
had presided over so many executions but he was proud that
Texas held criminals accountable for their crimes.After the 90-minute matchup, Bush spoke by telephone hookup
with Republicans at 200 debate-watching parties spread across
all 50 states.``Tonight I think the people saw a difference of philosophy
... a heavy hand out of Washington versus a helping hand,'' Bush
said. ``We've now finished the debate phase of the campaign and
it's now voter-turnout time. Grass-roots politics are going to
make the difference in the 2000 campaign.''

ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - Democrat Al Gore (news - web sites) went on the
