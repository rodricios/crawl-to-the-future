SAN JOSE, Calif. â€“ The online payments service PayPal has taken the unusual step of suspending many transactions in India for more than a week.

A spokesman for the service said Saturday that "personal payments" to and from India are being blocked. Transfers to banks in India are being suspended as well.

The spokesman, Anuj Nayar, said PayPal is taking the step while it answers questions that have arisen about the service. He declined to elaborate.

Nayar said the suspensions began Jan. 28. He wrote in a blog post that PayPal, which is owned by eBay Inc., hopes "to resolve the situation as quickly as possible."
