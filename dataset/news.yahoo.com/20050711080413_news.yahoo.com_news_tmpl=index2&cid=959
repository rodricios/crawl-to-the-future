<em><span class="timedate">Wed Jun 29, 3:34 PM ET</span></em>

							<p>It's a living language. but sometimes it's dead on arrival when people toss around euphemisms and gobbledygook. If a hospital charges $58 for a "thermal therapy unit," what is the patient getting for the money? Answer: an ice pack. Suppose a patient spots an "optical illuminator enhancer" entering his room. Should he be alarmed? No. The visitor is a window washer. If a doctor removes a patient's right kidney when he was supposed to remove the left one, no problem. It's merely an "error of laterality. ...</p>

Imagine: Interested in protecting their lucrative casino gambling interests, the tribes hire some top-drawer Washington influence peddlers. Nothing unusual there--influence, or access to the influential, is peddled every day in the nation's capital. In this case, maybe it even makes some sense that your lobbyists are Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon, two hired guns who liked to brag about their ties to powerful Republicans. ...</p></li>

No wonder over 60 percent of Americans think the country has swerved off track. But hold on. To lift your spirits, just spend a little time with leaders of the younger generation.</p></li>

But, surprisingly, patients who find out they have the illness are not completely lost in the dark. "I've spent the past year and a half sitting with these people," says Renee Beard, a medical sociologist at the University of California-San Francisco. "Yes, they're afraid when they hear the news. But they see positive things, too: They have time to plan, to take vacations with their families, to find support groups. And they're grateful for the time to do all this."</p></li>

As darkness fell last Wednesday, three apparently synchronized bombs exploded in a Shiite neighborhood, killing 23 people. With the rising sun came four more blasts in another Shiite part of Baghdad that killed at least 17 Iraqis. The dead were found in two mosques, a shopping area, and a bathhouse. Even in a city becoming inured to such horrors, this seemed staggering in its intensity--and its audacity.</p></li>

But Maine this summer is seeing more restlessness than relaxation. On June 1 in Kittery, just across the Piscataqua River from Portsmouth, N.H., roughly 8,000 people, most in bright yellow T-shirts declaring "Save Our Shipyard," converged on downtown with defiant cries of "We're No. 1!" The next day, about 75 miles up the coast, several hundred locals clustered together outside the Brunswick Naval Air Station at a chilly 7 a.m. toting signs saying, "Protect Our Homeland. ...</p></li>

Well, actually, they were in the pool, perched on barstools at the water's edge, at the granite counter of the Ottomeyers' outdoor kitchen. Sharon whipped up pancakes and hot dogs, but with a 48-inch rotisserie grill, plus side burners for griddle and wok cooking, a refrigerator, garbage disposal, and warming drawers, she could have handled anything, from a stir fry to cheese fondue.</p></li>

Stop right there, and find someone else to care for you. That might have prevented the hell that has broken out in Corpus Christi, Texas, because the now 13-year-old cancer-stricken Katie Wernecke and her parents refused doctor's orders. Her oncologist wanted radiation treatments to follow her four cycles of chemotherapy, which appeared to be working. Her parents feared its long-term toxicity, and for months they battled. ...</p></li>

Yet arthritis often strikes the young. "At night, I just cried and cried because my feet hurt so much," says 11-year-old Leona West of Springfield, Ill. And it hits the strong. "It was like having a dentist drilling into my knees," says Rich Kase, 52, of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, an insurance broker, former college football player, and self-described jock.

That fact surprises most people, including many doctors. Cheryl West is still angry about the misdiagnosis her daughter, Leona, received, and the extra suffering that it caused her. "When she was 4, her knuckles swelled up really big, and then her feet hurt, so we took her to our regular doctor. They told us it was just growing pains," says the Springfield, Ill., woman. It was another four years before a rheumatologist correctly diagnosed Leona. By that time, the girl had deformed toes and knobby fingers.</p></li>

British Prime Minister Tony Blair had been looking forward to shaping the EU under its new constitution in Britain's six-month presidency of the union, which starts next month.

That's hardly an uncommon occurrence, and typically, Muhamad would just report the incidents to U.S. marines tasked with securing the northwest section of this restive city. But this time, for the first time, Muhamad turned to Marine Corps Maj. Larry Huggins and offered his own plan to rout out the insurgents with a nighttime raid.</p></li>

"Things aren't getting better; they're getting worse. The White House is completely disconnected from reality," Hagel tells U.S. News. "It's like they're just making it up as they go along.

Immigrants come to America for many reasons, but mainly they come because it's the land of opportunity and upward mobility where achievement is more important than inheritance.
