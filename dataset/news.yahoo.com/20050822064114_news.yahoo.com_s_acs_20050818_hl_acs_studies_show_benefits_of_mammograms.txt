Most women know that getting a mammogram
is an important step they can take to protect their health. Two new
studies show just why this breast
cancer screening tool is so critical. 


One, published in the journal Cancer, shows
that, on average, women are being diagnosed with smaller tumors now than in
past decades. This is in large part thanks to earlier detection by
mammograms. The other study, published in the Journal
of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI), finds that women whose
breast cancer is first spotted with a mammogram tend to live longer than
those who find their breast cancer some other way (by feeling a lump, for
instance). And this held true even when the researchers looked at women
whose tumors were found at the same stage.

"These findings provide additional support for the importance of
adherence to regular
screening," said Robert Smith, PhD, director of cancer screening for
the 


American Cancer Society. ACS recommends that women begin getting yearly
mammograms at age 40 if they're at average risk of developing breast
cancer. Women at high risk may want to start screening before 40.

Tumor Stage Important

Although mammograms can't always find every problem in a breast, it's
well known among doctors that these x-rays can find smaller tumors than a
physical exam can. Finding a small tumor has many advantages; for one
thing, a woman who has a small tumor may be eligible for breast-conserving
surgery, rather than mastectomy, to remove it. 

But smaller tumors are also more likely to be early-stage tumors --
meaning they're less likely to have spread to surrounding tissue or lymph
nodes or other parts of the body. Tumor
stage can range from stage 0, the earliest form of breast cancer
(called carcinoma in situ), to stage IV, the most advanced form (where the
breast cancer has spread to other organs).

But tumor characteristics can vary even within a stage. 

"For example, within stage II disease there is a range from 'barely a
stage II' to 'nearly a stage III,' Smith explained, and prognosis depends
on which end of those extremes one is at. 

The research published in Cancer shows that mammograms not only
find smaller tumors, but also tumors that are more favorable within their
stage, Smith said.

Survival Advantage to Smaller Tumors

In that study, researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
in New York reviewed the size of breast tumors diagnosed between 1975 and
1999. The information came from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results), a huge 


National Cancer Institute database of US cancer
statistics.

Tumor size "decreased substantially" over those 25 years, Elena Elkin
and colleagues wrote. From 1975-1979, fewer than 10% of localized tumors
(those confined to the breast) were under 1 cm in size. But by 1995-1999,
about 25% of tumors were that small. Even tumors that had spread beyond the
breast into surrounding tissue or lymph nodes got smaller over time. About
20% of these more advanced tumors were smaller than 2 cm in 1975-1979; by
1995-1999, that proportion was up to 33%. 

Breast cancer survival also improved over that time period, both for
women with localized tumors and for those with more advanced breast cancer.
Much of that improvement was due to smaller tumor size, the researchers
determined. Especially in women older than 65, smaller tumor size provided
a big survival advantage.

The study published in JNCI suggests that there's even more to the story
than just improvements in tumor size and stage. In that study, researchers
from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston tried to compare survival between
women who got mammograms and those who didn't, but were diagnosed with the
same stage of tumor.

They used data from three large studies conducted in the 1960s and the
1980s, before mammograms were routine. As expected, women who got screened
were more likely to be diagnosed with earlier stage tumors. But even when
they compared women with the same stage of tumor, those whose tumor was
found by a mammogram did better.


Too Soon for Mammograms to Influence Treatment

The researchers, led by Donald Berry, PhD, say clinical trials should
start collecting information about how a breast cancer was detected so
doctors can learn how important this factor may be in predicting a woman's
outcome. But it's too soon for treatment decisions to be made based on that
information, Smith and other experts say.

The studies Berry and his colleagues used were older and didn't have the
same level of detail about the tumors, including the precision concerning
size, that is routinely collected today. This information would also
include whether the cancer has hormone receptors, for instance, or
expresses other biological markers that could influence treatment. 

When you take all those factors into account, Smith said, the biggest
advantage that mammography offers is that it gives women an opportunity to
start treatment earlier.

In an editorial published along with the study, other breast cancer
experts from Canada's Princess Margaret Hospital and the University of
Toronto say there haven't been enough studies to evaluate whether how a
tumor was found should influence treatment. Until more research is done,
they say, doctors and patients should rely on the established methods of
deciding treatment.
