CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - The two residents of the 


International Space Station floated outside Thursday and collected a close-to-lifesize radiation-measuring doll and other science experiments from the exterior of their orbiting home.

The spacewalk by cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and astronaut John Phillips came just 1 1/2 weeks after the departure of shuttle Discovery. The two left the space station vacant to accomplish the job; flight controllers in Houston and Moscow kept watch over the systems the entire time.
Working 350 kilometres up, Krikalev and Phillips retrieved bundles of research experiments that had been hanging on the outside of the complex for some time, so they could bring them back in for eventual return to Earth. Some of the packages were replaced with fresh specimens.
The biggest experiment they had to gather was called "matryoshka," the Russian name for the traditional nesting doll.
It's actually a nearly lifesize torso made of soft material to simulate human tissue with embedded sensors to measure radiation exposure, important information as 


NASA makes plans to send astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars. The doll was placed outside the space station last year.
"We are now against the window and we can see there's no one home," Krikalev radioed as he and Phillips hauled the doll inside.
Besides fetching the experiments, Krikalev and Phillips hooked up a TV camera that will be used when a new kind of cargo ship arrives at the station next year.
The spacewalk - which lasted five hours - was the only one scheduled for Krikalev and Phillips, who are four months into their six-month mission. It was the eighth spacewalk in Krikalev's long career and the first for Phillips.
Just this week, Krikalev became the most experienced space flier ever, exceeding the record of 748 days set in the late 1990s by cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev over three missions.
Krikalev spent two long stints aboard Russia's former Mir station, and flew twice on NASA's space shuttles. He also was part of the space station's first crew nearly five years ago.
