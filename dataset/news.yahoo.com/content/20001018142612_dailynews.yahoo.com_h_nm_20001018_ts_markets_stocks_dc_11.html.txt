By Haitham HaddadinNEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks were bloodied in early trade
Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow industrials index plummeting
more than 420 points at one point, putting it below 10,000, as
disappointing sales by computing titan IBM reignited worries
over corporate results.Adding to the pressure was economic data showing
consumer-level inflation grew last month above market
expectations.``IBM just confirms what other tech bellwethers were
telling us,'' said Eric Barden, portfolio manager with First
Austin Capital Management Inc. which oversees $50 million in
assets in Austin, Texas. ``Earnings and revenue growth are
disappointing and companies may be posting disappointing
results for the foreseeable future.''The Dow Jones industrial average was down 331.48 points, or
3.29 percent, at 9,758.23, having plunged earlier to a session
low of 9,654.64.The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 31.57
points, or 2.34 percent, at 1,318.40 and the technology-laced
Nasdaq Composite Index fell 136.06 points, or 4.23 percent, to
3,077.90.IBM, which issued its results after the close Tuesday, also
scaled back its outlook. IBM reported a 3 percent rise in
third-quarter sales, to $21.8 billion while the Street was
expecting sales of $22.4 billion. The weaker-than-expected
revenue growth figures overshadowed an 18 percent rise in
profit that met Wall Street estimates.IBM shares fell 20 percent, off $22 at $91 on the New York
Stock Exchange (news - web sites), lopping off as much as 130 points off the Dow.

expected, on average, a 0.4 percent rise in the September CPI,
compared to a 0.1 percent drop in August.``The CPI came in a little higher than expected ... but I
think it is shaded by the problems in the earnings,'' said Larry
Wachtel of Prudential Securities. ``The CPI is secondary to
that, it is a piling-on element, one more problem in a host of
problems.''
