Estrada's Foes File Impeachment Motion

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine opposition lawmakers started
impeachment proceedings against President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday, listing various charges including that he took
millions of dollars in bribes from gambling lords.

The filing of the impeachment motion sets the stage for
what could be a prolonged political conflict which could
further hurt an already bleeding economy and split the nation,
analysts said.

``The respondent committed bribery...committed graft and
corruption...betrayed the public trust (and)...culpably
violated the constitution,'' the 12-page impeachment motion
said.

It was endorsed by 42 congressmen, which included 36
opposition members and six lawmakers from the ruling coalition.

Estrada, whose ruling coalition has enough control of
Congress to theoretically overwhelm any impeachment move, has
denied allegations he received 414 million pesos ($8.7 million)
in gambling kickbacks, and vowed he would never resign.

The scandal has plunged the Philippines into its worst
political crisis in years, sparked calls for Estrada's
resignation from many sectors and savaged an already faltering
economy, with the peso currency crashing to historic lows.

``I will never do that...these people are crazy,'' the
embattled former movie actor, referring to demands he
relinquish office, told a crowd of 10,000 slum-dwellers in a
Manila suburb.

Estrada, whose presidency has been wracked by one scandal
after another, has served 28 months of his six-year term which
runs until June 2004.

Despite his public show of confidence, aides said Estrada
was clearly worried, holding meetings with supporters at the
presidential palace well into the night Tuesday.

Across the capital, the main avenue at Manila's Makati
financial district reverberated with sounds of ``resign, resign''
as about 10,000 rallied against the president.

Fidel Ramos, president between 1992 and 1998, added to the
chorus.

``Let me tell you that I am not only issuing my support for
President Estrada to resign and step down but also commend the
others who sounded the same call,'' he told reporters.

with confetti made from shredded telephone directories,

the chamber must vote to remove the president.

The House of Representatives has a heavy agenda and was

``It is us who have the numbers,'' congressman Danilo Suarez
