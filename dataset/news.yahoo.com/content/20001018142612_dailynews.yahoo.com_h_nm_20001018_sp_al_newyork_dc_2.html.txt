Yankees Beat Mariners to Set Up Subway Series

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Yankees rallied for six
runs in the seventh inning and held on for a 9-7 win over the
Seattle Mariners Tuesday to reach their 37th World Series and
first ``Subway Series'' in 44 years.

The Yankees, aiming for their third consecutive World
Series title and fourth in five years, beat the Mariners four
games to two in the American League Championship Series and
will face the New York Mets starting Saturday at Yankee
Stadium.

David Justice hit a three-run homer and Paul O'Neill a
two-run single in the pivotal seventh. Coming into the game,
Justice was hitting just .190 (4-for-21) in the ALCS and .205
this postseason and O'Neill, who like Justice had three RBI in
the game, only .188 (3-for-16) and .200.

Justice, who went 2-for-5 and scored twice, was named Most
Valuable Player of the series. ``It's the first time I've ever
gotten one of these,'' said Justice, the former Atlanta Brave
and Cleveland Indian who is the all-time leader in postseason
plate appearances. ``It's very special.''

Justice's three runs batted in gave him a team-high eight
for the series and 51 all-time, breaking a tie at 48 with
former Yankee Reggie Jackson for postseason RBI.

Starter Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez pitched seven-plus
innings, yielding six runs on seven hits with five walks and
seven strikeouts. He is the only pitcher ever to start his
postseason career with eight straight wins.

``I had almost nothing, I had no control at all, but I have
faith I can pitch,'' Hernandez said through an interpreter.
''Today the team rescued me.''

``El Duque has been there for us so often,'' said Justice,
''and today we picked him up. This is a special team with great
character.''

Closer Mariano Rivera's record for successive scoreless
innings in the postseason ended at 33 1/3 as he yielded a run
in the eighth. He escaped the ninth after Seattle superstar
Alex Rodriguez got his fourth hit of the game with two out but
was stranded when Edgar Martinez grounded out.

``I'm not worried about the run. I just wanted to get the
six outs,'' said Rivera.

The last ``Subway Series,'' between the Yankees and the
Brooklyn Dodgers, was in 1956.

``It's been a long time coming and the Mets/Yankees, it's
going to be exciting for the city,'' said manager Joe Torre.

Said Justice: ``I really believe that this is going to be

Rodriguez had two RBI, one in the Mariners' two-run first
and the other in their three-run eighth-inning comeback
attempt, which he started with a solo home run.

``I wasn't that worried when we were four runs behind, it
