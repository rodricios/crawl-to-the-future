 The troubled life of 


Natasha Lyonne has taken a tragic turn.


 The American Pie actress is in intensive care
at a New York City hospital with hepatitis C, a collapsed lung and a
heart infection, according to Access Hollywood and the New
York Post.  
 The 26-year-old actress, who hasn't
been seen publicly since a judge issued a warrant for her arrest in
April after she ducked a court hearing, is reportedly "fighting for her
life" and "struggling to survive," per Access Hollywood.

 "I'm crying actually. It's terrible, you know. It's my
little girl," Lyonne's father Aaron Braunstein told the syndicated show
Friday. "It's a terrible tragedy, but she's going to get better. We're
praying for her, and she's a tough girl." 
 The
Post reports that the actress is also receiving methadone
treatment, which is typically used to combat heroin addiction.

 It's not clear if Lyonne has been using the drug, but
according to a Mayo Clinic report, the primary mode of transmission of
hepatitis C is via contaminated blood--through needles shared by drug
users or through blood transfusions. The disease can lead to potentially
serious liver damage. 
 Braunstein, who told Access
Hollywood he visited his daughter last week, says he thinks Lyonne
may have picked up the virus while shooting a movie abroad three years
ago. 
 "She's probably with the wrong crowd," he said.
"The main thing, she picked up the liver thing in Bulgaria during
[filming of] The Grey Zone." 
 Lyonne, whose
credits also include Slums of Beverly Hills, Party Monster
and last year's Blade: Trinity, has not had a publicist or
Hollywood representation for the past several months, which have been a
rough stretch for the actress. 
 She was charged in
December with criminal mischief, harassment and trespassing after she
purportedly melted down on her New York neighbor, ripping a mirror off
the woman's wall and threatening to sexually molest her dog.

 Lyonne had been due in court Apr. 19 to answer the charges
but left the courthouse early, prompting Manhattan Criminal Court Judge
Abraham Clott to put out an arrest warrant. 
 The
Post claims that Lyonne was subsequently evicted from her
apartment and wound up living on the streets before turning up in the
city's Bellevue Hospital. She was then transferred to Beth 


Israel
Hospital, where she is currently admitted under a pseudonym, according
to the Post. Neither hospital has confirmed Lyonne's patient
status.  
 Speaking to Access Hollywood, her
father disputed the report that Lyonne was homeless and suggested he
might take legal action against the paper.  
 "There's
a confidentiality between patient, doctor and hospital, so all of this
is probably going to be a major lawsuit," he told the show.

 Lyonne previously pleaded guilty in 2002 to a DUI charge
in Miami. She was sentenced to six months' probation for the incident,
which involved fleeing the scene of a car accident.  
She last starred in the indie comedy Max & Grace, about a
suicidal couple who break out of a mental institution. The film
premiered at South by Southwest in Austin in March and has been making
the rounds on the festival circuit but has not yet been picked up by a
studio.
