MOSCOW â€“ A Russian cargo ship has sucessfully docked at the International Space Station, delivering supplies for its crew of five.

The Russian space agency said the Progress M-04M hooked up with the station Friday in a smooth automatic docking.

The vessel delivered 2.5 metric tons (2.75 US tons) of fuel, oxygen, food, water and other suplies. The shipment also includes scientific equipment and care packages for the crew.

The station is manned by Americans Timothy J. Creamer and Jeff Williams, Russians Maxim Surayev and Oleg Kotov and Japan's Soichi Noguchi.

Friday's docking marks the first time that two Russian Soyuz crew capsules and two Progress cargo ships are simultaneously docked at the station orbiting about 225 miles (360 kilometers) above Earth.
