EMC Profits Rise 55 Percent

HOPKINTON, Mass. (Reuters) - EMC Corp. (NYSE:EMC - news), the No. 1
data-storage company, said on Wednesday third-quarter earnings
rose 55 percent, beating estimates, on strong demand for its
software and refrigerator-sized machines that manage and store
information.

Before the market opened, EMC said it earned $458.2
million, or 20 cents a diluted share, compared with $295.8
million, or 13 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago period.

Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were
looking, on average, for EMC to earn 19 cents a share.

Total third-quarter revenues rose 34 percent to $2.28
billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the year-ago period. EMC
said its fastest growing market was the Asia Pacific region,
where storage revenue grew 130 percent in the third quarter.

EMC holds a nearly 35 percent market share of the
fast-growing market for networked storage, outdistancing its
nearest rival International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM - news),
which has 22 percent, according to the research firm Dataquest.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, EMC earned $1.2 billion
on total revenue of $6.25 billion, the company said.

``We undoubtedly gained market share again during the
quarter, not only in the overall market for storage but also in
each of the market segments we have identified as EMC
priorities,'' EMC Chief Executive Mike Ruettgers said in a
statement.

Total storage revenue in the quarter increased 47 percent
to $2.14 billion, the highest rate of growth for EMC in more
than five years, the company said.

Revenue from EMC's Clariion mid-range storage products
increased 40 percent to $165 million.
