WASHINGTON â€“ Tourists are making last-minute trips to Washington's monuments and museums before they likely get snowed in.

Small groups walked up slick steps of the Lincoln Memorial Friday afternoon, and a handful of people stopped by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the World War II Memorial.

Meanwhile, visitors streamed through exhibits at the National Museum of American History and other Smithsonian Institution museums along the National Mall. The Smithsonian museums planned to remain open through the end of the day but announced they would be closed Saturday.

Some out-of-town visitors say they wanted make the most of their trips and get out before the heavy snow hits. Some say they're worried they might not be able to make it out of the city this weekend.
