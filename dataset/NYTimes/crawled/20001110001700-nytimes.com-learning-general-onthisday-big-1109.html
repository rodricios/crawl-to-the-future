<IMG SRC="/web/20001207234500im_/http://www1.nytimes.com/images/t.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>he largest power failure in history blacked out nearly all of New York City, parts of nine
Northeastern states and two provinces of southeastern Canada last night.  Some 80,000 square 
miles, in which perhaps 25 million people live and work, were affected.</p>

<p>It was more than three hours before the first lights came back on in any part of the New York 
City area.  When they came on in Nassau and Suffolk Counties at 9 P.M., overloads plunged the 
area into darkness again in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Striking at the evening rush hour , the power failure trapped 800,000 riders on New York City's 
subways.  Railroads halted.  Traffic was jammed.  Airplanes found themselves circling, unable to 
land.  But the Defense Department reported that the Strategic Air Command and other defense 
installations functioned without a halt.</p>

<P>
<b>National Guard Called Out</b></p>

<P>
Five thousand off-duty policemen were summoned to duty here.  Ten thousand National 
Guardsmen were called up in New York City alone.  Other militiamen were alerted in Rhode 
Island and Massachusetts, as well as upstate New York.</p>

<P>
The lights and the power went out first at 5:17 P.M. somewhere along the Niagara frontier of 
New York state.  Nobody could tell why for hours afterward.</p>


<p>The tripping of automatic switches hurtled the blackout eastward across the state--to Buffalo, 
Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady, Troy and Albany.</p>

<P>
Within four minutes the line of darkness had plunged across Massachusetts all the way to 
Boston.  It was like a pattern of falling dominoes--darkness sped southward through Connecticut, 
northward into Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Canada.</p>


<P>
<b>Sputtering at 5:27</b></p>

<P>
At 5:27 P.M. the lights began sputtering in New York City, and within seconds the giant 
Consolidated Edison system blacked out in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and most of 
Brooklyn--but not in Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn that were interconnected with the 
Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey.</p>

<p>The darkness probed outward into northern New Jersey, up into Westchester and Rockland 
Counties, eastward into Long Island.</p>

<p>As far south as Washington, a Potomac Electric Power Company spokesman reported a power 
"dip" at 5:30 P.M., lasting less than a minute and virtually unnoticed in the nation's capital.</p>


<p>In Pennsylvania, the blackout spread through Pittsburgh and Reading into parts of Philadelphia 
and then into New Jersey along the coast above Atlantic City.</p>


<p>President Johnson, in Austin, Tex., ordered the full resources of the Federal Government thrown 
into an investigation by the Federal Power Commission.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
the Defense Department and other agencies were ordered to report "at the earliest possible 
moment."</p>

<P>
<b>Some Fear Sabotage</b></p>

<P>
Asked whether there was any belief that sabotage might have been involved, Bill D. Moyers, the 
President's Press Secretary, would say only that "all of the resources of the Government" were 
being invoked in the investigation.</p>

<P>
Later Mr. Johnson was advised that utility officials were "pretty well agreed upon the belief that 
there is substantially no chance of sabotage."  Mr. Moyers said one theory was that the failure 
had been in automatic frequency control equipment.</p>

<P>
Power companies, stripped of the protection of interconnected grids that would guard against 
minor failures, moved to isolate their areas to restore energy on their own.  This was how the 
Ontario Hydro Electric Commission, a Government-owned utility, cut away after loss of power 
for six million persons.  It began bringing power back at 6:15 P.M.</p>

<P>
In New York City, the Ravenswood plant in Queens, which provides 1.8 million kilowatts out of 
the 7.6 million produced by the city's Consolidated Edison plants, began sending smoke up from its stacks, as auxiliary steam power began to build up for its generators.</p>


<p>At 7:15 P.M. smoke began curdling up also from the Hudson Avenue station in Brooklyn.  It was 
from Hudson Avenue that the first power was restored here:  Five feeder cables of 27,000 volts 
each sent light back into Coney Island at 8:42 P.M.</p>


<p>An hour later Consolidated Edison reported 17 of the city's 60 feeder lines in operation.  But 
company officials indicated it would be many hours before the entire city's electricity could be 
brought back to life.</p>

<P>
About 1:30 A.M. today, Consolidated Edison informed Police Headquarters that it expected 
partial restoration of power in Manhattan by 4 A.M.  The company reported that 75 per cent of the power had been restored in Brooklyn and in parts of Queens and the Bronx.</p>

<P>
And a spokesman for the Federal Power Commission--its acting regional engineer in New York, 
John H. Stellman--said he did not know "whether Consolidated Edison could carry the peak load 
of New York City around 7 or 8 A.M., when people start getting up and going to work."</p>

<P>
Through the night, Consolidated Edison broadcast appeals to New Yorkers to shut off all 
appliances except radio sets to ease the burden on lines coming back to service.</p>

<P>
A matter of seconds may have stood between the city's being blacked out and its escaping 
trouble, William O. Farley, coordinator of public affairs and publications for Consolidated 
Edison, said.</p>


<P>
<b>Operator Notices Trouble</b></p>


<P>
Mr. Farley said a systems operator at the company's energy control center at 128 West 65th 
Street had noticed on his metered recording devices that some difficulty appeared to be starting 
on the interconnecting system with upstate utilities.</p>

<P>
The operator "immediately got on the phone with the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation to tell 
them that he was about to separate from the interconnecting system," Mr. Farley said.</p>

<P>
While he was trying to telephone his warning upstate, Mr. Farley said, the reserve demand for 
power from the stricken upstate area surged so high that automatic switches triggered protective 
equipment here.</p>

<P>
"And the system was down," Mr. Farley said.</p>


<p>In Austin, President Johnson was told by telephone at about 8 P.M. by his science advisor, Dr. 
Donald Hornig, that the best information available at that hour was that the failure had started at 
a switching point somewhere in the service area of the Niagara Mohawk Power Company.</p>


<P>
<b>Canada Finds No Flaw</b></p>

<P>
In Toronto, a spokesman for Ontario Hydro said, "To the best of our knowledge, the failure was 
in the United States."  He said, "we have checked every aspect of our system, and it is in order."</p>

<P>
The Ontario utility isolated itself from the United States system but found its power going on and 
off twice before it was able to restore service to metropolitan Toronto, an area of 2 million 
persons, about 8 P.M.</p>


<p>At 10 P.M., a New York State Power Authority official in Rochester said his agency believed the 
original break had occurred along the authority's 345,000-volt line between Rochester and 
Baldwinsville, a town north of Syracuse.  Crews looking for the break were reported 
accompanied by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>


<p>The Consolidated Edison system is directly connected from the energy control center here with 
five other power companies--Niagara-Mohawk, the Central Hudson Gas and Electricity 
Company, the Orange and the Rockland Utilities and the Connecticut Light and Power 
Company.</p>

<P>
<b>Last Failure in 1961</b></p>


<P>
The last major power failure to hit New York City took place on a 96-degree day--June 13, 1961.  
Five square miles of Manhattan were blacked out at that time for periods ranging from two and a 
half to four and a half hours at the start of afternoon rush hour.  Subway service was either halted 
or slowed.</p>


<p>The blackout was ascribed to failure of circuit breakers because of faulty insulation, and it was 
followed by a $25 million construction program here that included the building of three new 
power substations.</p>


<p>Yesterday's trouble struck again, when the homebound rush was under way, but on an autumn 
day when twilight was nearly past and night was closing in.</p>


<p>The Transit Authority estimated that 800,000 persons were riding in the subway systems.  Many 
trains managed to creep into stations in time.  Stranded riders on others had to make their way 
along tunnel catwalks, shepherded by employees with emergency lights.</p>



<P>
<b>Thousands Walk on Bridges</b></p>

<P>
Thousands of persons hiked across the Brooklyn and Queensboro Bridges.  On the Queensboro 
span, cars crawled behind the trudging pedestrians.  At 8:40 P.M., police halted motor vehicle 
traffic on the Manhattan bridges' lower level, to permit persons who had been caught on BMT 
trains on the bridges to get off and walk.</p>

<P>
Long lines of homegoing New Yorkers searched out and queued up for buses.  The Transit 
Authority reported 3,500 of its complement of 4,000 vehicles operating.</p>

<P>
Tremendous traffic jams block the city's streets.  The Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive on the East 
Side and the Miller Highway on the West Side were still clogged more than five hours after the 
blackout started.</p>


<P>
The Brooklyn-Battery and Queens Midtown Tunnels were closed because the power failure had 
cut off their ventilation.  The Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge to 
New Jersey remained opened.</p>


<P>
<b>Railroads Suspend Service</b></p>


<P>
Railroad lines from Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station went out of service, 
forcing commuters to search for alternate transportation.</p>

<P>
Some taxi drivers were demanding $10 to $15 for rides between points in Manhattan.</p>


<P>
Thousands of New Yorkers were caught in elevators in the city's skyscrapers.  Many of the city's 
elevators are equipped with safety devices to take them down to the next floor, where doors can 
be opened manually in the case of power failures.</p>


<P>
In the Pan-Am Building, the city's largest office structure, 14 passengers were trapped in three 
elevators for hours after the blackout.  Shortly before 11 P.M. workmen cut out a section of a 
fifth-floor wall to extricate five of the trapped persons.  They expected to have to dig into other 
walls to rescue the remaining nine.</p>

<P>
Kennedy International and LaGuardia Airports were shut down within minutes of the power 
failure until about 8:30 P.M.  Two hundred planes were diverted to fields in Philadelphia; others 
went to Newark and Hartford, and the Defense Department ordered its military fields to accept 
any emergency air traffic.</p>


<P>
Tens of thousands of airline passengers were involved.</p>


<p>The New York Telephone Company reported it had provided service in all its central offices 
through emergency power.</p>


<P>The Fire Department's radio was out of service from 5:30 to 8:30 P.M.  Dispatchers kept in touch 
with firehouses and vehicles by telephone.</p>


<P>
Walkie-talkies were used for some Fire Department communications.  The department was said 
to be taking advantage of panoramic views of the city from flying helicopters.</p>

<P>
The Police Department summoned 5,000 off-duty patrolmen by broadcasting the order over the municipal radio station WNYC.  Off-duty firemen were also called in.</p>

<P>
The extra policemen were directed to report to precincts in their home districts if they were 
unable to reach their regular stations.</p>


<P>
<b>Armories Become 'Hotels'</b></p>


<P>
Civil defense workers were called to duty over WNYC by Robert E. Condon, city director of 
civil defense.  Their auxiliary policemen helped free subway passengers and directed traffic.</p>

<P>
Police Headquarters said that four Manhattan armories had offered overnight accommodations 
for persons stranded in the city.  These were at Park Avenue and 66th Street, Park Avenue at 
34th Street, Lexington Avenue and 26th Street, and Fort Washington Avenue and West 168th 
Street.</p>

<P>
Most of the city's hospitals had emergency power supplies of their own.  Emergency generators 
from the civil defense organization and private companies were delivered by the police to a half-
dozen hospitals.</p>

<P>
All nine television channels in the metropolitan area were forced off the air.  Radio stations were 
silenced by the initial blackout, but at least eight came back on their own auxiliary power in 10 to 
15 minutes.</p>

<P>
WNBC broadcasts with five kilowatts and WCBS with 10; both normally use 50 kilowatts.</p>

<P>
<b>Broadway Theatres Shut</b></p>


<P>
Broadway theatres and movie houses were shut, but off-Broadway the show went on by 
searchlight at Theater East, 211 East 60th Street, where three performers played Arkady 
Leokum's two one-acters, "Friends" and "Enemies" before an audience of seven humans and two 
dogs.</p>

<P>
The self-sufficient transistorized radios had their finest hours, supplying the only information for 
millions of persons otherwise cut off from the news.</p>

<P>
Virtually every hotel room in the city was taken and there were reports that some stranded 
commuters had climbed 30 stories for a night's haven.</p>


<P>
<b>National Guardsmen Mobilized</b></p>


<P>
At first all National Guard commands throughout the state were alerted by Governor Rockefeller, 
but as power was restored upstate only 10,000 guardsmen, most of them from the 42d Infantry 
Division, were ordered to report to armories in the city for emergency duty last night.  The 
armories reported that guardsmen responded "in fair numbers," although many had transportation 
problems.</p>

<P>
Five hours after the blackout, the police reported five arrests on looting charges, all in the 
Brownsville and Bedford-Stuyvesant sections of Brooklyn.  There were also some reports of 
minor vandalism, but generally New Yorkers appeared to have been on their best behavior.</p>

<P>
In the suburbs, a bright spot in the Hudson Valley was the town of Walden.  Five thousand 
residents got light from a Wallkill River hydroelectric station that had been idle for some time.</p>

<P>
The New York State Electric and Gas Corporation had sought to abandon the plant as no longer 
economically feasible.</p>
