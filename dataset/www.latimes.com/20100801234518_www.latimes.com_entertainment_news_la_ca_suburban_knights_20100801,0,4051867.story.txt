										Lord Kuma. E.F. Kitchen, a Venice-based, fine arts photographer who works with platinum prints, spent years fascinated by the glint of light off hand-made armor. "Knight's new book, "Suburban Knights: A Return to the Middle Ages," captures dozens of these warriors in full battle regalia. The photographs are Platinum/Palladium prints, printed on Arches Platine paper.
