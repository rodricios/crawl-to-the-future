Environmental activist George Wolfe has always believed the best way to know a river is to kayak it. So when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently designated the entire Los Angeles River a "traditional navigable waters," he organized an expedition.

Toting
a waterproof first-aid kit and a sack of binoculars, Wolfe led seven
people clad in T-shirts, shorts, sun hats and life vests to a lush,
eight-mile stretch of river bottom near Griffith Park known as the
Glendale Narrows.

Awaiting them downstream were quiet pools
draining into noisy chutes, strewn with shoes, clothing, shopping
carts, tires and plastic bottles, and shaded by cottonwood trees, cane
forests and cattails. Plastic grocery bags snared in tree limbs rustled
in the breeze. The river was running warm, greenish and, as one of the
kayakers put it, "smelly as old socks."

Normally, the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers and the Los Angeles County Department of Public
Works, which have operated the river for decades as a flood-control
channel, would not allow such a voyage because of safety and
water-quality concerns. In this case, however, they would neither
approve nor deny a boating permit pending clarification of what was allowable in the river under the new EPA designation.
