  During the Television Critics Assn. media tour at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Wednesday, one show seemed to be on everyone's mind: CBS’ new sitcom “Mike & Molly.” 

The show follows a couple who meet as they battle the bulge by getting support at Overeaters Anonymous and has quickly gained momentum. At a time when reality television seems to be cashing in on being overweight, with shows like "Biggest Loser," "Celebrity Fit Club" and "Money Hungry," being bigger is slowly starting to become fodder for scripted shows.

But are viewers ready to see a lead cast that isn't thin? (Shows like "Huge" and "Drop Dead Diva" have gotten accolades for plus-sized stars.)

With the cast and crew front and center, most of the talk was about weight.

“To me, the show is not about weight,” said Melissa McCarthy, who stars as Molly. “It’s just not the axis that the show revolves around.”

Her co-star, Billy Gardell -- who plays Mike -- dealt with a barrage of questions including if the lead stars planned on losing weight, whether or not they were satisfied with their size and even how the characters were costumed because of their size.

“Yeah, we’re fat, and the show is funny,” he said. “So what? That’s not it."

Reader Steve G responded to the Show Tracker story: "Considering the hefty number of morbidly obese Americans sucking up snacks while plunked in front of the plasma, I'd say a feel-good show about enormous fat people will not only find an audience, but eat the competition alive."

We are curious to know, in a world of Hollywood standards is primetime ready for a plus-sized sitcom? With so many reality shows focusing on dropping the pounds -- quickly -- will a show about plus-sized characters succeed?
