I am not saying they don't deserve to be happy to be but can we finally stop hearing about it now.  I haven't been about to turn out my TV for weeks if not months without hearing about this wedding from the final fitting to every single bag that pops up "just might be carrying" one of the outfits she might be wearing this weekend!!  I am sorry, anymore, who freaking cares!!  HILLARY IS NO LONGER OUR PRESIDENT PEOPLE!!!! 

We have a little 7 year old boy missing in our state shouldn't the news be paying attention in finding him instead of making sure her dress was fitting perfectly or not?My family went to a wedding yesterday too, it wasn't broadcasted all over the news:  maybe it wasn't because never straddled the desk of the fathers or one of them never or one of the fathers never robbed a bank.  True, one of the mother thinks she's Hillary's long lost sister,  but that's another story. And another thing during this recession...it's wonderful that the Clinton have no problem letting snobbery show, hopefully noone ran into any walls with their noses sticking that high  in the air announcing how much their spent on this wedding and the money they spnt on that gown............who really paid for this wedding anyways too?????
