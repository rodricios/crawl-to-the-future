Our country is moving toward the dissolving European model, a model which after years of problems and failure they seem to be moving away from.  Yet this administration can't see the forest for the trees.  For example, when you closely examine the 2,000 plus page health care legislation you suddenly realize how incompetent this government really is!  When you look at the deficit we and our future generations face you wonder if we are emulating countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal, rather than Germany, France and the UK.
