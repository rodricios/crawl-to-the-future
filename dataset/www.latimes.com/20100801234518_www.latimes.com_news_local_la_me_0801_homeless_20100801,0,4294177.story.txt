(1400 character spaces is just not enough) People have to participate in their recovery - don't we see that from real (not celebrity) drug programs that have schedules for chores, classes, therapy sessions, etc.?  There HAVE to be accountability requirements for a program like this to work.  There are already too many carrots (welfare and disability checks) being disbursed that are going for everything but necessities - ask LAPD Central Division about the dope dealers who extend credit lines that are equal to the monthly entitlement check. Quite an enterprise!  

In hospitals they have 'step down' units where patients go after they have made progress from their illness, and move from there towards discharge or the next phase in rehab or convalescence.   I remember one gentleman on Skid Row who did not take his meds as scheduled, and his bi-polar outbursts weren't considered a really big deal - until the afternoon he tried to beat another man into the ground over an imagined slight - then he was kicked out onto the street to find his own way.  There are holes in this program that need to be filled before there is a casualty.
