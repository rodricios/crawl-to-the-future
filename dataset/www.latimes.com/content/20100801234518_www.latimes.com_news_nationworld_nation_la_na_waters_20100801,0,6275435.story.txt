Mark Twain said it best a long time ago:  "The only native criminal class in America is Congress." 

We need worthy public servants---duh---but they're so rare.  And it's mind blowing that ordinary people---many with college degrees---support them.  In fact, the ones w/ college degrees seem like the dumbest of all. 

What did Lincoln ask?  "Can a country so conceived, survive?" (to paraphrase quickly from the G Address.)  That is, can human beings handle living in a free society or will they destroy it?  Maxine Waters is a prime example of the abuse of our system and that's precisely why she needs to be punished.  I hope she looks good in stripes.
