<p>Unfortunately, despite having suffered a lifetime of derrière discontent (along with most American women,&#0160;I would venture to say) I couldn&#39;t just take heart and cancel my gym membership. I had to ask -- butt why? And this being an opinion page,&#0160;I had to wonder what it meant that women were&#0160;going for bigger glutes.&#0160;Is this something like high heels and hemlines,&#0160;which increase in economic hard times? Does it mean we&#39;re in for another market collapse and the bustle is on its way back?&#0160;</p>
<p>So the first thing I did was to consult&#0160;the local butt expert, Erin Aubry Kaplan, who wrote a whole <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://bit.ly/925Qse">essay</a>&#0160;on the topic for the LA Weekly more than a decade ago. &quot;It means beauty standards are shifting in the right direction,&quot; Kaplan said. </p>
<p>You might recall that Kaplan drew a lot of heat&#0160;from African Americans in particular for&#0160;focusing attention on First Lady Michelle Obama&#39;s behind&#0160;in a&#0160;2008 <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://bit.ly/925Qse">Salon.com article</a>&#0160;and declaring herself &quot;free at last&quot; with a new beauty norm.</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;I&#39;m a black woman who never thought I&#39;d see a powerful, beautiful female with a body like mine in the White House. Then I saw Michelle Obama -- and her booty,&quot; Kaplan wrote. </p>
<p>Here at The Times, we have said that&#0160;the athletic, <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://bit.ly/a2O6G0">real-woman-with-curves</a> first lady is an excellent leader for the government&#39;s&#0160;campaign against childhood obesity, which has tripled since 1980, precisely because she has this figure and wears a dress size that average American women can aspire to.&#0160; </p>
<p>Surgical butt enhancement has been around for a long time, either with implants or &quot;a kind of reverse liposuction,&quot; so apparently not only was I late to the trend,&#0160;the Journal was too.&#0160;In Kaplan&#39;s&#0160;mind, padded panties are a lot better than surgery. I had to agree, although I can&#39;t help but think&#0160;they&#39;re two sides of the same coin: As with the perky push-up bra, these are ways for women to&#0160;transform themselves publicly into something&#0160;they&#39;re not. At the end of the day, they still have to go home, take off the padded underwear and&#0160;accept who they are.</p>

Among other things, his plan would push the retirement age back to 60 from he current 55 for new hires (Whitman would move it back to 65) and would require employees to cover more of the cost of their pensions. Perhaps most important, he would revert to the old formula of basing pensions on a worker&#39;s average salary for his or her three final years on the job, not just the last year; bar pension benefits from being increased retroactively; and cap benefits for the highest paid workers.</p><p>But Brown stopped short of the one step I think would do the most to fix the pension problems caused by the Dills Act: Unlike Whitman, he wouldn&#39;t replace the pensions for new state employees with 401(k) plans.</p><p>Under the current system, public employee unions can (and do) use their political muscle to help elect candidates who are receptive to their contract demands. In essence, the unions are bargaining with the same people who rely on them for campaign cash and manpower. When budgets are tight, these officials can hold the line on wages but raise pensions, pushing the costs onto future budgets (and office-holders).</p><p>With a 401(k) system, however, there&#39;s less room for elected officials to boost benefits. Sure, they could increase the matching contributions the government makes to its workers&#39; accounts. But there&#39;s no way to retroactively pad the benefits, and no risk that highly paid employees could collect whopping retirement packages, a la the top officials in Bell. Nor would reducing the retirement age have an effect on the amount taxpayers would be obliged to pay.&#0160;</p><p>That&#39;s because switching from defined-benefit (pension) plans to defined-contribution (401(k)) plans shifts risk from the employer to the employee. The latter could prove more valuable to employees, depending on how well they invested their retirement savings. There&#39;s no floor to benefits in a 401(k) approach, but no ceiling, either.</p><p>Some of my colleagues on the Times&#39; editorial board disagree with me on this issue because, they contend, the pension state government provides helps make up for the below-market wages it pays. But I don&#39;t think public employers should be expected to offer a retirement benefit that private employers have largely abandoned.</p><p>-- Jon Healey</p><p><em>Photo: Former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown talks up pension reform on behalf of Gov.

Gen.&#0160;Jerry Brown makes no bones about the fact that he&#39;s a career politician, but his current <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.jerrybrown.org/">campaign website</a>&#0160; blurs Brown&#39;s roles as campaigner and public servant to a degree that seems ... unusual.</p>
<p>Most officeholders take pains to separate the work their campaigns do from the work done by their taxpayer-funded staff. But on the website for Brown&#39;s gubernatorial bid, press releases written by the office of attorney general are <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.jerrybrown.org/press/releases">mixed freely</a> with those from Brown&#39;s campaign. As I&#39;m writing this, the site&#39;s news section leads off with &quot;Brown&#39;s Elder Abuse Bureau Seeks Other Victims of Home Health Care Worker Who Stole Thousands from Elderly Client&quot; and &quot;Hate Crimes in California Drop 20% in 2009&quot; (two releases from the AG&#39;s office) before getting to a campaign piece titled &quot;Fake Ad, Fake Plans, Fake Candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown&#39;s accomplishments in office are fair game for his campaign. Brown&#39;s campaign spokesman, Sterling Clifford, noted that the AG&#39;s press releases are public documents. &quot;It&#39;s free information that&#39;s out there for anyone to post anywhere,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;It&#39;s not like they&#39;re doing extra work for us.&quot; </p>
<p>But by treating the official releases the same way it does campaign pronouncements, Brown&#39;s site suggests that there&#39;s no distinction between the public servant and the campaigner. Granted, many voters already believe that every step politicians take is meant to advance their prospects at the polls. But in truth, the good ones aren&#39;t that cynical.</p>
<p>&quot;We would be foolish not to present that information,&quot; Clifford said. I agree; Brown&#39;s site should trumpet what Brown does as AG. But it should do so in its own words, just to make abundantly clear that there is a line between Brown&#39;s current job and his aspirations for a new one.</p>

	<p>The <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704684604575381083191313448.html">controversy about Journolist</a> -- the defunct <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=03&amp;year=2009&amp;base_name=obligatory_journolist_post#113791">e-mail list</a>&#0160;for left-of-center opinionaters, reporters and advocates -- strikes some of my colleagues as much ado about nothing. After all, it&#39;s not surprising that people who write liberal opinion pieces for blogs, magazines and newspapers would express liberal opinions in private. But I think that there&#39;s a gap on this issue between the general public and newspaper insiders who understand the difference between commentary and news.</p>
<p>From what I can tell as a nonmember, Journolist offered its members a way to get feedback from policy wonks about the topics they were covering, as well as to see what other members were interested in. That&#39;s typical of any number of e-mail lists, including ones dedicated to a subject (e.g., the environment) as well as others that hew to a particular point of view. Reporters are supposed to tap as many sources as possible, and e-mail lists (like news readers and Twitter feeds) can be an effective way to do that.</p>
<p>The excerpts published by the Daily Caller, however, show another feature of Journolist: opinion writers and bloggers analyzing news events together, joined <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/22/when-mccain-picked-palin-liberal-journalists-coordinated-the-best-line-of-attack/2/">in at least one case</a>&#0160;by Democratic strategist Ed Kilgore. Although I don&#39;t trust the Daily Caller to be an honest broker -- it&#39;s an outpost for conservative commentary, after all -- I don&#39;t like the group-think on display in these excerpts either.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to keep in mind the <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/76407/the-journolist-conspiracy-continues">ginormous difference between participating in a discussion and observing it</a>, as Jonathan Chait pointed out this week. It&#39;s silly to hold the entire list responsible for the opinions expressed by a handful of its members. Ignoring a nutty message isn&#39;t tantamount to endorsing it. Only someone who&#39;s never been on an e-mail list would argue that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;m puzzled why so many people who should have been competing with each other to be the first to publish a choice bit of analysis or commentary would have freely shared their thoughts. And I also wonder whether they ever stopped to consider what the public would think about a bunch of like-minded commentators from different outlets comparing notes. If there were many hard-news reporters on the list, they don&#39;t show up in the excerpts I&#39;ve seen so far. So that&#39;s a saving grace. Still, even those of us in the opinion business ought to be fiercely competitive -- in private and in public.</p><p><strong>Updated, 3:53 p.m.:</strong> For those who want to see the latest volleys in the dispute among inside-the-Beltway insiders, Ezra Klein (the founder of Journolist) offers a <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/first_time_as_tragedy_second_t_1.html">must-read critique of the Daily Caller&#39;s stories</a>, which <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/22/letter-from-editor-in-chief-tucker-carlson-on-the-daily-callers-journolist-coverage/">Daily Caller editor Tucker Carlson responds to</a> (sort of). Klein ripostes with a revealing tidbit or three about <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/when_tucker_carlson_asked_to_j.html">Carlson&#39;s attempt to join Journolist </a>(which Klein supported, but others on the list did not). </p>

	title:'Chummy Journolists [UPDATED]',	
	summary:'The controversy about Journolist -- the defunct e-mail list for left-of-center opinionaters, reporters and advocates -- strikes some of my colleagues as much ado about nothing. After all, it\'s not surprising that people who write liberal opinion pieces for blogs, magazines and newspapers would express liberal opinions in private. But I think that there\'s a gap on this issue between the general public and newspaper insiders who understand the difference between commentary and news. From what I can tell as a nonmember, Journolist offered its members a way to get feedback from policy wonks about the topics they were covering,...',

	<p>Twenty years ago, Mike Godwin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.wired.com/culture/geekipedia/magazine/geekipedia/godwins_law">postulated</a>&#0160;that the longer a debate continued in an online discussion group, the more likely someone would liken the other side to Hitler. Such nuclear rhetoric would invariably shut down the debate.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking that we need to update Godwin&#39;s observation. Not that <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/08/rush-limbaugh-compares-new-health-care-logo-to-nazi-swastika.html">over-the-top Nazi comparisons</a>&#0160;have gone out of vogue; they&#39;ve just been supplemented in online debates by over-the-top accusations of socialism. </p>
<p>I thought about this today as I was reading the comments on <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2010/07/park-your-opinion-here-on-state-parks.html">Karin Klein&#39;s post about Proposition 21</a>, the ballot measure that would increase the registration fee for noncommercial vehicles by $18. The money would go to the state park system, which would be required to eliminate its entry fees. </p>
<p>The post attracted dozens of comments, and the overwhelming majority backed the fee. The response was so lopsided, I felt compelled to check to make sure the comments weren&#39;t all coming from the same computer (they weren&#39;t). It wasn&#39;t until late Wednesday afternoon that reader &quot;damjr&quot; weighed in with a detailed argument against the proposition, asserting that it would generate millions for nongovernmental conservation groups.</p>
<p>And then reader &quot;john petro&quot; posted comment Nos. 67 and 68, first against the tax increase, then against the people who support it. Here&#39;s an excerpt from the latter (the typos are his; the emphasis is mine):</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">After reading many comments i now understand why this state is so screwed up, most of you are as stupid as the people who run this state. I use the state parks also and want to continue to do so, but i am getting tired of the panic that our politicians create when they overspend taxpayer dollars and then threaten to close this or shut down that because they spent all the money.... It is simply unbelieveable how many of you dont mind being taxed a little more. <strong>Go to China or Russia you might feel more comfortable there</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, &quot;My opponents are socialists.&quot;</p>
<p>Somebody with the Internet cred of Mike Godwin needs to point out this new line of demarcation so we can name it after him or her. In the meantime, I&#39;ll just call it Trotsky&#39;s law.</p>

	<p>Memo to the Union of Concerned Scientists: When you lead off a press release with <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/big_picture_solutions/ca-economists-letter.html?utm_source=SP&amp;utm_medium=head&amp;utm_campaign=CAeconomistletter07-19-10head">the phrase</a> &quot;Top economists agree,&quot; you&#39;ve just lost your audience.</p>
<p>In truth, top economists don&#39;t agree about much of anything, which helps explain why the nation is currently in&#0160;such an&#0160;economic fix. Climate change is one subject on which disagreement, among economists if not climate scientists, is particularly rife. So when the UCS puts out an <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/big_picture_solutions/ca-economists-letter.html?utm_source=SP&amp;utm_medium=head&amp;utm_campaign=CAeconomistletter07-19-10head">open letter</a> from &quot;more than 100 Ph.D. economists with expertise in California energy and climate issues,&quot; all of them opposing Proposition 23, it&#39;s bound to raise a few eyebrows even among true global warming believers. I have no doubt at all that the backers of Prop. 23 could put together an equally distinguished panel of economists who favor the measure.</p>
<p>UCS actually roped in 118 academics, led by Stanford Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow, to warn that &quot;delaying action now and waiting for the future before initiating accelerated action to reduce global warming gases will be more costly than initiating action now&quot; (apparently their doctorates weren&#39;t in English). That&#39;s nice, but the letter won&#39;t have much influence over voters when they weigh in on <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i902_initiative_09-0104.pdf">Proposition 23</a> -- the November ballot initiative that would suspend California&#39;s mandated curbs on greenhouse gases until the state&#39;s job market improves. The crowd that&#39;s skeptical about climate change already has a problem trusting academics. If you don&#39;t believe the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the National Academies of Science or the national academies of the entire developed world, you&#39;re probably not going to put much stock in a panel of eggheads put together by the Union of Concerned Scientists. And if there&#39;s any field of study that inspires less public&#0160;confidence than climatology, it&#39;s economics.</p>

The Stolen Valor Act made it a crime to claim falsely to have received medals and other military decorations. </p>
<p>As The Times observed in an editorial in February: The law &quot;would criminalize speech that, although admittedly offensive, is far removed from the kind of serious crime -- such as extortion, fraud or incitement to riot -- in which speech merges into harmful conduct and may therefore be outlawed. And if Congress can make it a crime to lie about or exaggerate one&#39;s military record, why wouldn&#39;t it be constitutional to criminalize misrepresentation about educational attainments or the circumstances of one&#39;s birth?&quot;</p>
<p>The judge&#0160;likewise focused on free-speech issues. He also offered a pithy reply to the argument that misrepresentations about receiving military decorations diluted their significance: &quot;This wholly unsubstantiated assertion is frankly, shocking and indeed, unintentionally insulting to the profound sacrifices of military personnel the Stolen Valor Act purports to honor,&quot; Judge Robert Blackburn wrote. &quot;To suggest that the battlefield heroism of our servicemen and women is motivated in any way, let alone in a compelling way, by considerations of whether a medal may be awarded simply defies my comprehension.&quot;</p>
<p>A more practical objection to the law is that, thanks to the Internet, it is easy to find out if someone is &quot;stealing honor.&quot; For example, the names of&#0160;Medal of Honor recipients can be accessed at a convenient <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.cmohs.org/">website</a>. And if a military resume-padder is a public official, the odds are even better that he will be caught in a lie. Just ask Richard Bluementhal, the U.S. Senate candidate who wrongly claimed to have served in Vietnam -- and was outed by <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/nyregion/18blumenthal.html?_r=2">the New York Times</a>.</p>

	<p>The campaigning has started early for <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.yesforstateparks.com/get-the-facts/fact-sheets/general-fact-sheet">Proposition 21</a>, the state parks initiative, and why not? This is the season when people swarm to the state beaches, hit the trails&#0160;and set up their tents and RVs in the parks&#39; campgrounds. This is also the summer when a date for two at a movie matinee can cost less than dropping by a public park. (OK, not including the hideously priced popcorn.) Daily parking at Crystal Cove State Beach, for example, costs $15 after the state&#39;s fiscal crisis forced higher fees.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to mention the&#0160;reduced services at the parks and&#0160;the backlog of maintenance.</p>
<p>Those will be among the issues for the editorial board to consider as it examines Proposition 21, which would impose an additional $18 annual fee on non-commercial vehicles to raise money for California state parks. In exchange, the public would be given free access, all year long, to those parks.</p>
<p>But&#0160;the public schools, Cal State University and University of California are all hurting too. Why no vehicle registration fee for them? Or for the state&#39;s children who need medical care but whose parents can&#39;t afford or get health insurance?&#0160;Libraries, home health services ... if state funding is involved,&#0160;you can pretty much count on a program in distress.</p>
<p>Should state initiatives pick off individual needs with individual funding sources? That&#39;s something the Times editorial board has seldom endorsed, but these are uncommon times.</p>
<p>And would this added fee be worthwhile to you? How often do you visit the state&#39;s parks? Which ones? And how often would you go if it were free?</p>

	<p>Today&#39;s installment of the <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-tea-party-20100719,0,5302758.story">is-the-tea-party-racist story</a> (or <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-naacp-tea-party-20100715,0,1332659.story">non-story</a>, depending on your point of view) focused on the split between the National Tea Party Federation and Sacramento-based Tea Party Express, which refused to oust one of its leaders over <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://blog.reidreport.com/2010/07/tea-partier-mark-williams-writes-open-letter-to-lincoln-from-the-coloreds/#more-15246">an objectionable blog post</a> mocking the NAACP. (For those of you who missed the weeklong kerfuffle, the <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-naacp-20100713,0,4807232.story">NAACP adopted a resolution</a> at its national convention accusing the tea party movement of harboring &quot;racist elements.&quot;) I thought the Tea Party Express won that rhetorical debate with its <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://lat.ms/9oOmyJ">hysterical put-down of the federation</a>. Sample quote:</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">To add to the absurdity of the &quot;Federation&quot; they have also informed us that our members can&#39;t participate in something called their &quot;basecamp&quot; communication network, which makes us think that the individuals involved in the &quot;Federation&quot; spend a bit too much time watching science fiction movies and cartoons. </p>
<p>Anyway, the Tea Party Express spokesman who triggered the controversy, Matt Williams, offered <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.marktalk.com/blog/?p=10387">a defense online</a> that seemed to focus more on the NAACP needing to change its name than on Williams&#39; apparent need for sensitivity training. I won&#39;t quibble with his point about the organization clinging to a long-abandoned racial descriptor. I do, however, find something telling in the following sentences from his apologia:</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">I have removed the parody letter you came here to read and urge you to fight those who seek to divide us by race, no matter the color of the racist. Our fight is against tyranny and for liberty and to see that this nation continues the lofty goal of equality for all set for us by our founders. </p>
<p>On racial issues, the founders were not, ahem, role models. A not-insignificant number were slave owners, and the ones who weren&#39;t -- including a strong anti-slavery contingent from the Northeast -- were willing to enshrine into the Constitution the idea that <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/documents/documents_p2.cfm?doc=306">slaves amounted to only 3/5ths of a free person</a>. The compromise was for the purposes of taxes and congressional representation, but the symbolism was unmistakable. The founders&#39; &quot;lofty goal of equality&quot; also seems to have overlooked women.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to condemn the founders for their pragmatism -- they recognized the southern colonies wouldn&#39;t join the new nation if it outlawed slavery. (For a more vigorous defense, read Daniel Webster&#39;s 1850 speech <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=476">&quot;The Constitution and the Union.&quot;)</a> It&#39;s just to say that Williams, like many folks who don&#39;t like the direction the country seems to be headed, assigns values to the founders that those gentlemen did not possess. That&#39;s an argument for celebrating how the country&#39;s values and sense of decency have evolved over time, rather than pretending that things have gone steadily downhill since the late 18th century.</p>

<p><strong>Updated, Friday 11:30 a.m.:</strong> Falling on his sword, Matt Williams announced this morning that he was <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/hostedemail/email.htm?h=025a6af94b3b1cd1def693458da9cc80&amp;CID=6640029715&amp;ch=C7B9B1AFC86EC27EFC980D1DB0BD7752">cutting all ties with the Tea Party Express</a>.The money quote:</p>

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">This nation is in crisis, and beyond the struggling economy and suffocating deficits, is what I consider to be the most troubling development recently:&#0160; this nation’s slide towards socialism and abandonment to the fundamental Constitutional principles that have made America great.&#0160; I do not wish to be used as ammunition against our own cause so to that end I am removing myself from the equation and severing ties to the Tea Party Express.</p>

<p>Yet more evidence to support my proposed <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2010/07/updating-godwins-law.html">Trostky law</a>!</p>

In both cases there are significant issues still to be resolved; the Dodd-Frank bill left regulators to settle scores of questions about what financial companies would be required to do, and the criminal probe into Goldman Sachs&#39; behavior continues.</p><p>Both the bill and the settlement lose appeal the closer you examine them -- the former intrudes in too many areas yet takes too cautious an approach to the major weaknesses in the current system, and the latter seems more like a wrist slap than a gut punch. But I think they both head in the right direction and make the financial system better than it would be otherwise. Dodd-Frank&#39;s efforts to regulate derivatives, stop banks from making risky investments with insured deposits, shed light on systemic threats and improve the government&#39;s authority to dissolve failing institutions are all good things. Having Goldman Sachs admit that it didn&#39;t disclose enough to investors is a good thing too.</p><p>More important, though, is the subtle pressure that both the bill and the settlement will bring on the financial industry to care more about the fate of the deals they engineer. Allow me a quick diversion here. Critics of Dodd-Frank say it ignores Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing-finance behemoths that helped feed the subprime-loan mania. Fannie and Freddie were a factor and <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/27/opinion/ed-fannie27">they need to be restructured radically</a>, but keep in mind that they got into the subprime game late, after they&#39;d lost a significant share of their market to Wall Street firms. More important, reforming Fannie and Freddie wouldn&#39;t be the GOP&#39;s cause <em>du jour </em>if lenders during the housing bubble had cared whether their customers could repay the mortgages they were being sold.</p><p>Dodd-Frank prohibits some of the most predatory home-loan practices. More broadly, it requires that financial institutions insure that borrowers have a reasonable chance of repaying the loans they take out. In addition, it requires the companies that package loans into securities and sell them to investors to keep a small but meaningful stake in those securities. That &quot;skin in the game&quot; mandate should deter companies from trying to pass ill-conceived loans and investments off to buyers with less information about their contents.</p><p>The housing bubble was just the most recent crisis. The next bubble will almost certainly involve some other kind of asset. What drives a mania is the belief among investors that the market is rising so inexorably that it doesn&#39;t matter what they buy -- there will always be someone else willing to pay more for it eventually. And the enablers of the mania are the lenders who provide the cash investors need to make their imprudent purchases -- loans that lenders are happy to make because they, too, aren&#39;t concerned about getting stuck with an asset of declining value.</p><p>There may be no way to prevent this kind of boom-and-bust mentality, but barring lenders from making loans that can&#39;t reasonably be repaid and requiring companies to keep a stake in the loans they securitize should help. So should telling Wall Street firms that they can&#39;t create products that are designed to fail for some customers in order to benefit others. As small as the Goldman Sachs penalty may be in relation to the company&#39;s profits, it&#39;s still a significant amount of money -- enough to tell other Wall Street firms that bundling a bunch of toxic securities into a new product is risky for them as well as their customers.</p><p>-- Jon Healey</p><p><em>Photo credit: Frank Franklin II / Associated Press</em></p><p></p>

<p>A blogger who goes by Andromeda Perseus linked to our <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2010/07/bristol-and-levi-back-together-again-but-why.html#tp" target="_blank">Bristol Palin blog post</a> on her site, <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://bustysuperherochick.blogspot.com/2010/07/note-to-bristol-palin-its-trap.html" target="_blank">Busty Superhero Chick</a>, advising Bristol that she should be wary of her upcoming nuptials and remain skeptical of her husband-to-be -- who, Perseus suggests, may only be in the marriage for the money and the fame attached to it. Evidently, Perseus doesn&#39;t see much in common between Levi Johnston and <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.astro.wisc.edu/%7Edolan/constellations/extra/PerseusStory.html">her Greek namesake</a> when it comes to rescuing damsels in distress.</p>

Henry argued that there were no downsides to the methods used to find the Sleeper&#39;s&#0160;alleged true identity, saying&#0160;that time spent researching other methods only means time for murderers and rapists to &quot;find more victims.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, Emma Trotter of <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://pocketchange.become.com/2010/07/lebron-james-shows-traits-of-his-generation.html" target="_blank">Be in the Game</a> agreed with <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-wartzman-job-loyalty-20100713,0,3194077.story">Rick Wartzman&#39;s assertion in his July 13 LeBron James Op-Ed</a>&#0160;that James is part of a generation more interested in maximizing their paychecks than in remaining loyal to an employer or a community. Trotter offered this advice to employers hoping to attract and keep young workers: &quot;A sense of social responsibility, challenges and new opportunities, a sensitivity to work-life balance and ongoing development and training programs are all appealing to recent graduates.&quot;</p>

Err, well, perhaps that&#39;s not so unusual -- not many of these cases have actually reached juries, and judges have <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://lat.ms/bQy3Kj">tossed out the damage awards</a>&#0160;in the two most widely publicized cases so far. What made District Court Judge Nancy Gertner&#39;s ruling unusual was her finding that the amount of damages had violated the Constitution,&#0160; even though the jury had awarded damages in the lower range of the amounts approved by Congress. </p>
<p>The Times&#39; editorial board, which has complained in the past about the magnitude of statutory damages in copyright law, will probably weigh in on the ruling within a few days. In the meantime, I asked the folks at <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://bcdash.bigchampagne.com/">BigChampagne</a> to help me with a thought experiment about the right level of compensation for file-sharing infringements.</p>
<p>In the case of file-sharer Joel Tenenbaum, jurors awarded the major record companies $22,500 per song. I wondered what that would work out to if the Recording Industry Assn. of America managed to collect such a sum from everyone sharing those songs. Granted, that&#39;s not going to happen, especially with the industry <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://lat.ms/9fbW1N">no longer suing file-sharers</a>&#0160;en masse. But Tenenbaum was just one person sharing those files -- one of many sources for others to download from. And on a file-sharing network, there&#39;s not much difference between Source A and every other person offering a particular song.</p>
<p>I sent the titles of nine of the songs Tenenbaum had shared to BigChampagne. Diving into the data it collects from file-sharing networks, it reported that those songs -- all rock and rap hits by the likes of Eminem and Nirvana -- were being offered by nearly 6.8 million file-sharing computers. At $22,500 per song, that&#39;s $152 <em>billion </em>-- many orders of magnitude more revenue than those songs could have generated even in a world with no infringement. Assuming those nine songs were representative of all 30 of the tracks Tenenbaum infringed, the amount increases to half a <em>trillion </em>dollars. </p>
<p>Even at the reduced level set by Gertner -- $2,250 per song -- the extrapolated amount is staggering. If all 6.8 million file-sharers with those nine songs were dunned that amount, the labels would collect $15 billion. That&#39;s more than the total amount of music sales in the U.S. each year. Not bad for nine songs.</p>

<p><strong>Updated, 4:32 p.m.</strong>: Eric Garland of BigChampagne points out that the numbers his company provided are just for file-sharers in the U.S. If I&#39;m not mistaken, there&#39;s some of that behavior overseas as well.</p>
<p>The point here isn&#39;t to defend Tenenbaum, who first lied about his file-sharing and then tried to defend it in <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2009/08/11/joel_tenenbaum_opens_faq_to_help_explain_file_sharing_ruling">the most self-serving way possible</a>. &quot;Art is meant to be shared&quot;? You might get away with saying that, Joel, if you ever paid for it. I&#39;m just noting here that $22,500 per song makes sense only in a world where one infringer is held liable for the acts of millions. It&#39;s true that the Internet enables a single person to become a global infringer. But does that mean juries should act as if each pirate they encounter is devastating the industry singlehandedly?</p>

<p>Updated, 10:37 a.m. Friday: Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, sent in a lengthy reply this morning. Here is it, unedited:</p>

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Your analysis (about how much money record companies would earn if all file-sharers paid the statutory damages award) implicitly presumes that statutory damages should reflect actual damages (i.e. the sales revenue that was actually lost).&#0160; But that&#39;s not what stat damages are about.<br /><br />

Statutory damages were specifically created by Congress as an alternative to actual damages -- in part because actual damages are often difficult to calculate, but even more importantly, to provide meaningful deterrence.&#0160; How much of a deterrent effect would you have if you reduced statutory damages to some modest amount on the ground that everybody else was infringing, too?&#0160; The greater the illegal conduct, the less each violator would have to pay, reducing the risk to the point that the deterrent effect is lost.&#0160; How, then, would you deter the theft?<br /><br />

Congress chose to impose meaningful risk on infringers that they could have to pay substantial damages even if it couldn&#39;t be proven that the actual damages were significant.&#0160; That&#39;s a sensible way of achieving a policy of deterring infringement. Your &quot;experiment&quot; yields precisely the opposite effect of what Congress intended.<br /><br />

As you may recall, we didn&#39;t ask the jury for any particular level of damages.&#0160; We left the amount completely up to the jury.&#0160; I presume that they took into account the fact that Tenenbaum forced us to spend a lot of time and money litigating the facts of a case in which the facts were completely clear except that he lied about them repeatedly, and under oath; that he tried to pin the blame on others; that he continued stealing music even after he was sued; that he never showed any remorse; all that kind of stuff, beyond just the impact on the industry.&#0160; Isn&#39;t that what you&#39;d want a jury to consider in picking a damage award?<br /><br />

Isn&#39;t that precisely how a jury deters misconduct? Should such egregious misconduct (and disrespect for the court system) be beyond the scope of the jury&#39;s damage award because, if every infringer were also sued, we&#39;d recover too much?<br /><br />

Statutory damages also reflects another basic practicality -- that every infringer is NOT going to be sued.&#0160; Just like every speeder is not going to be caught.&#0160; Or every looter captured.&#0160; So you provide real consequences for the unlucky few who get caught to deter all the others.<br /><br />

Should a looter&#39;s liability be reduced because, if he hadn&#39;t stolen the TV, another looter would have anyway?<br /><br />

I fear your &quot;experiment&quot; proves too much.&#0160; And your embracing it would give it credibility it doesn&#39;t deserve.</p>

<p>He makes a good point about damages needing to deter other infringers. Nevertheless, I don&#39;t think a jury needs to go to $22,500 per song, or $675,000 in all, to offer an appropriate deterrent in addition to compensating the labels for their losses. Gertner&#39;s formulation -- $67,500 for 30 songs -- strikes me as a whopping deterrent.</p><p>Battling file-sharing is a game of whack-a-mole, and copyright holders won&#39;t increase their score by using a bigger hammer.</p>

<p>Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston have announced to <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.usmagazine.com/healthylifestyle/news/exclusive-bristol-palin-levi-johnston-are-engaged-2010147">Us Weekly their plans to make their way down the wedding aisle</a>. That is, they announced them for a second time. You might recall that their first attempt fell apart after the 2008 election: Johnston backed out at the last moment, turmoil ensued, and the denouement was <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/17/levi-johnston-playgirl-ph_n_360730.html">a nice tell-all article and photo spread of Johnston in Playgirl</a>. Strange how those things work.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'"></span>The obvious irony here is that, having made &quot;family values&quot; such an important part of her politics, Mom Sarah Palin (like husband Todd) was the last to know about Bristol and Levi&#39;s renewed nuptial plans.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/opinion/15collins.html?src=me&amp;ref=generalhttp://" target="_blank">Gail Collins in her New York Times column</a>, Bristol claims she went to Us Weekly to unveil her arrangements because she was too afraid to confront her mother directly. Really, Bristol? Is that&#0160;<em>really </em>the reason? </p>
<p>Are you sure it wasn&#39;t&#0160;just the common teenage desire to lash out at one&#39;s parents, particularly one&#39;s mother? At 19, Bristol is, after all, still a teenager. </p>
<p>Or is the widely publicized news of Palin&#39;s second entanglement, err, engagement an effort to generate a media frenzy right before the young couple announces&#0160;a new reality series? Talk of a potential&#0160;Palin reality show has been buzzing around on gossip blogs for a while, and no Palin family member or representative has refuted the rumors. In a <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/us/politics/15bristol.html?scp=3&amp;sq=bristol%20palin&amp;st=cse">New York Times article</a>, when Johnston&#39;s lawyer was asked about the supposed series, he responded with, &quot;I can&#39;t talk about that until the end of the week.&quot; That&#39;s not the kind of answer that quashes speculation, is it?</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, it appears that Bristol&#39;s new family does have&#0160;values; it&#39;s just that those values don&#39;t necessarily include her old family.</p>

Probably not Iroquois, but the tribe was among the founders of the game, about 1,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Today, an Iroquois lacrosse team is having a little more trouble with&#0160;its signature game. They&#39;re&#0160;supposed to play in the <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.2010worldlacrosse.com/news/1/102">world championships</a> in Manchester, Britain, but the <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hPUaekX__CcOphQuE-BRfEIyHLRAD9GVJOT81">British government</a> has said, &quot;Not with those funny passports, you don&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>As subjects&#0160;of a sovereign government that stretches from the United States into Canada, the Iroquois carry the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; passports of their tribal nation, and those passports haven&#39;t been beefed up to meet current global security requirements. Team members could get U.S. and/or Canadian passports -- and they&#39;ve already received special permission from the U.S. government -- but they see this as a matter of&#0160;ethnic pride. According to <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/sports/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-us-lacrosse-iroquois-passports,0,1446919.story">the&#0160;most recent reports</a>, they&#39;re still huddled at a New York airport, awaiting word from Britain, after forfeiting their first game.</p>
<p>Given the shortness of time, maybe the British government could lighten up a bit. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who ordered the last-minute reprieve on this side of the Atlantic, obviously doesn&#39;t consider the team to be a security risk.</p>
<p>But the Iroquois and other sovereign Indian nations should be forewarned: The ethnic-identity&#0160;argument doesn&#39;t overrule international security concerns. In the future, either they bring their passports up to standards, accept&#0160;U.S. (or Canadian or Mexican passports, as the case may be) passports or stay at home with their sticks.</p>

That&#39;s the case with <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/europe/16vatican.html">revisions</a> in church law strengthening discipline for priests who abuse minors. Article 6 of new &quot;Substantive Norms&quot; published this week extends to 20 years the statute of limitations for accusations of abuse before church tribunals and adds possession of child pornography and the abuse of mentally disabled adults to a list of &quot;more grave <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d123.htm">delicts</a> against morals.&quot; </p>

<p>But before you get to Article 6, there is Article 5, which deals with another &quot;grave delict&quot; -- the attempt to ordain a woman as a priest, an offense that can lead to excommunication. (Other articles deal with offenses such as desecrating the Eucharist and violating the seal of the confessional.)&#0160; A reader can be excused for thinking that the church sees a moral equivalence between ordaining women and abusing a child. </p>
<p>To be fair, that interpretation was rejected by the Vatican&#39;s internal prosecutor, who said that &quot;sexual abuse and pornography are more grave dealings, they are an egregious violation of moral law. Attempted ordination of women is grave, but on another level.&quot; And it is true that sexual offenses are described as &quot;grave delicts against morals,&quot; while ordaining women is simply a &quot;grave delict.&quot; But that fine print is easy to overlook. </p>

<p>Poor PR is the least of the Vatican&#39;s derelictions in responding to the sex-abuse scandal. But appearances do matter, and including sexual abuse and the ordination of women in the same document is a public-relations disaster.</p>

	I&#39;m not an&#0160;apologist for the Tea Party movement, but I&#39;ve seen no evidence that the movement is pervaded by racism. Certainly, it&#39;s <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html">predominantly white</a>, and certainly it has attracted some racist nuts. (Along with some non-racist ones. A <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-us-iowa-obama-billboard,0,1903236.story">billboard</a> comparing President Obama to Hitler and Lenin is crazy, but it&#39;s not racist.)
<p>Still, I see a fairness problem with the NAACP&#39;s resolution calling upon Tea Party leaders to &quot;repudiate those in their ranks who use racist language in their signs and speeches.&quot; (The quote is from an NAACP <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.naacp.org/news/entry/naacp-delegates-vote-to-repudiate-racist-elements-within-the-tea-pary/">press release</a> which does not provide the text of the resolution.) </p>
<p>Calling on an organization to denounce abhorrent behavior by some of its devotees may seem reasonable. But it implies that the extremists/bigots/bombers are a sufficiently significant component of the organization that such a gesture is necessary. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a clever rhetorical device that anyone can use to put a movement or a cause on the defensive, and it often serves the ulterior motive of discrediting the organization through guilt by association. In the case of the NAACP and the Tea Party, it had another negative consequence: more publicity for <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.adn.com/2010/07/14/1366498/palin-denounces-naacp-for-accusing.html">Sarah Palin</a>.</p>

	<p>Here are a few of the blogs that commented on The Times&#39; commentaries this week:</p>
<p><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://womenshealthnews.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/weekly-news-round-up-another-three-day-weekend-edition/">Rachel Walden of Women&#39;s Health News</a> vehemently backed <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-johnson-libraries-20100706,0,5371729.story" target="_blank">Marilyn Johnson&#39;s July 6 op-ed on the importance of libraries</a>, saying that although she didn&#39;t particularly enjoy Johnson&#39;s book on the topic, she firmly agreed with all of the author&#39;s points in the op-ed.</p>
<p><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-brodesserakner-20100707,0,2074342.story" target="_blank">Taffy Brodesser-Akner&#39;s July 7 op-ed on the added burdens pregnant women suffer at the hands of well-meaning neighbors</a>&#0160;was cited by Caitlin E. Borgmann on her blog, <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/reproductive_rights/2010/07/pregnant-women-constantly-bombarded-with-comments-from-strangers.html#tp" target="_blank">Reproductive Rights Prof Blog</a>, who said that while she appreciates people&#39;s attempts at civility more than Brodesser-Akner does, she too finds the whole charade rather annoying.</p>
<p><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_07/024703.php" target="_blank">Steve Benen of Washington Monthly</a> responded to Jonah Goldberg&#39;s argument in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-goldberg-gop-20100713,0,4930254.column" target="_blank">his Tuesday column</a> that Republicans have viable ideas worthy of congressional action. Benen disagreed, saying that Republicans have failed over the years to present a coherent agenda -- not because they fear they won&#39;t be listened to, but because they know it would be unpopular. </p>
<p>On his blog <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://donklephant.com/2010/07/13/gridlock-is-good/" target="_blank">Donklephant</a>, Justin Gardner commented on <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-mcmanus-republicans-election-20100710,0,2364904.column" target="_blank">Doyle McManus&#39; Sunday op-ed piece discussing the difficulties the Republicans face in creating a unified platform</a> for the upcoming election in November. Although there <em>are</em> a number of different platforms the Republicans could take, Gardner argued, the party doesn&#39;t have to rally around a single one to succeed.</p>

<p>The reaction from proponents of decency rules was muted, but the other side wasted no time saying, in effect, good riddance to bad rubbish. &quot;The FCC&#39;s excessively broad, incomprehensibly ambiguous and utterly subjective indecency policy has put creative, challenging, controversial, non-homogenized broadcast television programming at risk,&quot; said Jonathan Rintels of the Center for Creative Voices in Media. &quot;In many cases, the very kinds of television programs that parents want their children to watch -- high-quality documentaries, histories and dramas --&#0160;have been affected.&quot;</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski was characteristically noncommittal. “We’re reviewing the court’s decision in light of our commitment to protect children, empower parents and uphold the 1st Amendment,&quot; he said. Well, duh.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that federal law prohibits &quot;obscene, indecent [and] profane language&quot; on licensed broadcast stations, and it&#39;s the FCC&#39;s job to enforce that prohibition by responding to viewer complaints. So what should it do? Take our highly unscientific poll, add a comment below, or do both!</p>

	<p>It has been eight months since Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that 9/11 &quot;mastermind&quot; Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other accused terrorists would be tried in a federal court. On Sunday, Holder eloquently made the case for civilian trials as opposed to trials before the less-tested forum of a military commission. Unfortunately, President Obama doesn’t seem to be listening.</p>
<p>Appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Holder asked: “Why can’t we use a great criminal justice system that has proven effective in these kinds of case over the years, that has proven effective in a wide range of cases over the last 200 years, why can’t we use that system? It is that system that we have often said distinguishes us from other countries.”</p>
<p>Holder cited one reason for the delay in the 9/11 trial: opposition in Congress to civilian trials.&#0160; But it might be easier to persuade Congress to endorse them if the White House showed some leadership and supported Holder, instead of engaging in a prolonged internal debate. For Holder, preaching the value of civilian trials begins at home.</p>

Thanks to a 44-year-old prohibition designed to help the then-fledgling Dulles International Airport, transcontinental flights aren&#39;t allowed into or out of the airport closest to the nation&#39;s capital. Under the &quot;perimeter rule,&quot; points more than 1,250 miles west of Reagan National Airport are off-limits to most direct flights. That&#39;s <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.gcmap.com/featured/20100708">far enough to reach Dallas, Wichita and Fargo</a>, but not Denver, Las Vegas, Seattle, San Francisco or Los Angeles.&#0160;</p><p>The restriction has been relaxed ever so slightly over the last decade, allowing a total of 12 round-trip flights to six cities outside the perimeter -- including one (count &#39;em, one) to LAX. The lucky carrier holding the rights to that route is Alaska Airlines.</p><p>The perimeter rule has outlived its original purpose -- Dulles is now busier than Reagan National. But the rule is <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070605250.html">still supported</a> by the agency that oversees both airports, as well as Virginia&#39;s senators and some local activists. This side argues that the rule is important to limit noise pollution around Reagan National, preserve service to smaller cities in the eastern half of the country and protect Dulles.&#0160;</p><p>The third argument is hard to stomach, considering how well established Dulles is. Favoring Dulles over Reagan National is tantamount to favoring Dulles&#39; dominant carrier (United Airlines) over Reagan National&#39;s (US Airways). In a concession to the first two concerns, Sens. John Ensign (R-Nev.),&#0160;Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and five others have proposed to let the airlines serving Reagan National <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.1209:">shift some of the flights</a> now going to &quot;large hub airports&quot; to any airport beyond the existing perimeter.</p><p>The bill&#39;s sponsors have since agreed to allow only two dozen such shifts per day, said Doug Parker, chief executive of US Airways. The result would be fewer flights to highly competitive destinations within the perimeter, such as Atlanta and Chicago, and more to the West -- probably 12 more each day to LAX, San Francisco and San Diego.</p><p>In an interview Monday, Parker argued that the change wouldn&#39;t increase the noise level because the longer flights would be made either by the planes already in use today or larger ones that are actually quieter on takeoff and landing. It&#39;s also worth noting that the longer flights would account for only about 6% of the daily traffic at Reagan National.</p><p>The best argument for lifting the perimeter rule is that it would promote competition on transcontinental routes, which should make flights from LAX to Washington less expensive. That&#39;s what happened when <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/07/07/the-war-over-long-distance-flights-at-reagan-national-opening-u/">Congress eliminated a similar rule handicapping Love Field in Dallas</a> four years ago. It can, and should, happen for service to Washington too.</p><p>The fate of the proposal is tied to a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. That measure has been stalled largely because of a dispute over a House-passed provision that would make it <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2009/may/22/house-bill-seems-to-target-fedex/">easier for employees at FedEx to unionize</a>. House and Senate negotiators have been meeting informally, but there won&#39;t be a vote on a final version unless its Senate sponsors can line up 60 votes. They&#39;re rushing to reach that threshold this week, Parker said; here&#39;s hoping that the perimeter rule will be left at the gate.</p><p>-- Jon Healey</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think of the filmmaker (and admitted child molester), there&#39;s an interesting issue here about the rule of law and the role of the Swiss, who have studiously cultivated their reputation as secret-keepers. If Los Angeles authorities really did double-cross Polanski and renege on the deal that led him to plead guilty to having unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 (a 13-year-old girl whom he&#39;d been charged with drugging and raping), should he be able to contest his treatment in a neutral forum? Or does the fact that he&#39;s a fugitive who fled the country before he could be sentenced mean that he has to come back to Los Angeles to make his case?</p>

	<p>When attempting to memorize&#0160;ballot propositions for an upcoming election, &quot;fun&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily the first word that springs to mind. For most, the words &quot;labor-intensive&quot; are far more applicable. </p>
<p>The job becomes much easier once connections have been formed between the proposition and its meaning. </p>
<p>The&#0160;most obvious connection between title and topic can be found in Proposition 23. This proposition deals with repealing AB 32, an environmental law passed in 2007. Switch around the numbers in 32, the number found in the title of the law, and you get 23, which corresponds directly to the number of proposition. </p>
<p>It&#39;s simple enough, but then again, it&#39;s only one of the 10 measures to be voted on in November. More convenient combinations will be available soon. Until then, be a prudent voter and keep reading up on the propositions to ensure you&#39;ll enter the voting booth on Nov. 4 informed!</p><p>-- Emilia Barrosse</p>

For most, the words \"labor-intensive\" are far more applicable. The job becomes much easier once connections have been formed between the proposition and its meaning. The most obvious connection between title and topic can be found in Proposition 23. This proposition deals with repealing AB 32, an environmental law passed in 2007. Switch around the numbers in 32, the number found in the title of the law, and you get 23, which corresponds directly to the number of proposition. It\'s...',

	<p>I&#39;m always glad to see same-sex marriage take a step forward, but there&#39;s still a measure of irony in a federal judge&#39;s <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.scribd.com/doc/34072925/DOMA-decision">ruling today</a> in Boston that the federal Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional because it interferes with states&#39; authority to regulate marriage. The act stipulates that the federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage. States are free to make their own decisions on the matter, but they also are free not to recognize such marriages performed in other states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&#39;re still waiting for a federal judge in San Francisco to rule on whether Proposition 8 is unconstitutional, but the argument there is practically&#0160;the&#0160;reverse of the one in the DoMA case. Opponents of Proposition 8 say that recognizing marriage only between a man and a woman violates the U.S. Constitution, which is effectively arguing for federal authority to require states to allow same-sex marriage. In fact, the Boston judge ruled in a separate but related case that DoMA also violates the equal-rights clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p>One issue involves the powers of Congress, the other&#0160;a possible case of federal unconstitutionality. But you could understand someone getting confused about who holds the marriage reins. Obviously, if the Constitution (as interpreted by the federal courts) mandates that states must stop discriminating against homosexuals in marriage laws,&#0160;states have no&#0160;authority to ignore it, any more than they should have the right not to allow couples of different races to wed. It&#39;s a day the editorial board would like to see.&#0160;</p>

The act stipulates that the federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage. States are free to make their own decisions on the matter, but they also are free not to recognize such marriages performed in other states. Meanwhile, we\'re still waiting for a federal judge in San Francisco to rule on whether Proposition 8 is unconstitutional,...',

Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday took the next peck by <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/schwarzenegger-signs-landmark-egg-bill-into-law.html">signing a bill</a> to extend the same protections to out-of-state birds.</p>
<p>How can California do that? Using the power of the marketplace, more specifically the power of the huge population of egg consumers in the Golden State.</p>
<p>Proposition 2, sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States (see <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-pacelle28-2008oct28,0,4332310.story">this op-ed</a> from its CEO),&#0160;banned cages for chickens (and pens for veal calves and pigs) that are so small the animals can&#39;t turn around or fully extend their limbs. The law, of course, applies only to animals raised in California.</p>
<p>Much to the <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-dawn21-2008oct21,0,1110640.story">irritation of humane activists</a>, <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/25/opinion/ed-2prop25">The Times editorial page urged that voters reject</a> the Nov. 4, 2008 initiative. We expressed concern in our editorial that the well-intentioned measure would merely outsource animal misery by encouraging the import of cheaper out-of-state eggs. </p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; we wrote, &quot;California eggs would become more expensive, and many consumers would simply buy the cheaper eggs laid by hens living in cramped conditions in neighboring states or in Mexico. As a result, we fear the result of Proposition 2&#39;s passage would not be better treatment of hens but merely the export of their mistreatment.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, soon after <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/05/local/me-props5">Proposition 2 was adopted</a> (with 63.5%, or more than 8 million votes, in favor), there were <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2010/02/idaho-chicken-prepare-for-california-egg-exodus.html"></a><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://">official moves afoot in Idaho, N</a><a>evada</a>&#0160;and other states to lure California producers to move their hens and their businesses to more producer-friendly territory. Democratic Assemblyman Jared Huffman of San Rafael, joined by Republican Tom Berryhill of Modesto and Democrat Dean Florez of Shafter -- all of which are egg-producing districts -- responded with <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_1401-1450/ab_1437_bill_20090227_introduced.pdf">AB 1437</a>. The bill&#0160;bans the sale of eggs in California unless they were laid by chickens under roughly the same space guidelines&#0160;as those that Proposition 2 applies to eggs raised here.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger took the unusual step of <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://dl5.activatedirect.com/fs/distribution:letterFile/yvcee9xanplikz_files/yytvrbuiymlh1c?&amp;_c=d%7Cyvcee9xanplikz%7Cyytym3jouspvhx&amp;_ce=1278523561.158b20ff17c162183f2dd44450d50e35">including a message with his signature</a>, explaining that the law is good for egg producers as well as animals. He certainly also saw that Californians, who can&#39;t agree on much, are overwhelmingly in favor of animal welfare. In other words, the governor was saying, &quot;Nobody here but us chicken-lovers.&quot;</p>
<p>So we at The Times editorial page got what we wanted, and all&#39;s well that ends well, right? Right? Yes -- except that it&#39;s still worth noting, as we did in our editorial, that the <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2009/02/eggs-food-food.html#tp">price of eggs here&#0160;may go up</a>. Or not. See <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://http//articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/06/business/fi-farm6">this Times story</a>&#0160;published after the vote explaining that prices would be unaffected -- in large part because cheaper out-of-state eggs would be imported. Things are different now that imports must follow the same cage guidelines.</p>
<p>How different? It&#39;s hard to predict, because we don&#39;t know how many out-of-state producers will retool to keep or grab a share of the California market, so we can&#39;t calculate the supply-demand equation. I strongly suspect that among editorial writers, just as among voters, the question of chicken welfare is based at least as much in emotional response as in reasoning, policy and economics. No matter the&#0160;price increase,&#0160;some of us would still say &quot;Don&#39;t be cruel to chickens!&quot; and others would say &quot;Huh? They&#39;re just chickens!&quot; </p>
<p>A few&#0160;loose ends: (1) This doesn&#39;t&#0160;make California cage-free. Many, probably most, egg producers here will continue to raise their layers in cages. (2) AB 1437 applies only to &quot;shelled eggs,&quot; which should make any non-lawyer say, &quot;Wait, <em>what, </em>huh? Does that mean eggs that are no longer in their shells, sort of like &#39;shelled walnuts&#39; means walnuts that have been removed from their shells, or &#39;pitted prunes&#39; means prunes with their pits removed?&quot; No, don&#39;t worry. It means eggs still in their shells, sort of like &#39;bottled water&#39; means water contained within a bottle. Really. They promise. And (3) Why does this law not take effect until 2015? Is government really that slow? No, it&#39;s because Proposition 2 was written to give California producers sufficient time to revamp their operations to get into compliance, so the bill gives out-of-state producers the same time.</p>
<p>By the way, the photo above is not of California chickens but of their <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2010/07/maine-egg-farm-works-to-improve-chicken-conditions-following-flap-over-undercover-video.html">counterparts in Maine</a>, and accompanied a story about the Humane Society&#39;s campaign against cruelty to the birds in that state -- just in case there was any question about the society keeping up the fight after its California victory.</p>

<p>This is difficult to document, but there&#39;s a &quot;What They See/What They Mean&quot; dynamic on both sides of the debate over illegal immigration. I&#39;m talking now about mainstream opinions on both sides, not talk-show rants (&quot;Send them all home!&quot;) or the rallying cries of demonstrators (&quot;We didn&#39;t cross the border; the border crossed us&quot;).</p>
<p>What (some) mainstream supporters of comprehensive immigration reform say: &quot;We believe that illegal immigrants should pay a penalty and go to the back of the line of citizenship seekers.&quot; What they mean: &quot;We don&#39;t&#0160;really want to punish &#39;undocumented citizens&#39; (as one activist put it in a Freudian slip), but we have to throw the yahoos a bone to in order to enact what we won&#39;t call amnesty.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other side is the mainstream anti-illegal-immigration mantra.&#0160; What they say: &quot;I have nothing against<em> legal</em> immigrants. America is a melting pot and rightly so.&quot; What they mean: &quot;Why do I have to choose &#39;English&#39; when I call my bank or make a deposit at the ATM? What has happened to my country?&quot;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t expect people (or politicians) to fess up to these covert positions. But don&#39;t discount them.<br />

Or is the tearful Lohan a prima donna who&#0160;expected her fame and fortune to buy her leniency? <br />
<p>I think it&#39;s the latter.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years, stories of Lohan&#39;s escapades have provided ample fodder to gossip magazines, newspapers and blogs. They&#39;ve been impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>So no one should have been too surprised to see a picture of the distraught Lohan on the front page of Wednesday&#39;s LATExtra section, with a caption saying she&#39;s headed for jail and then rehab for something she <em>hadn&#39;t</em> done — attend weekly alcohol education classes previously ordered by the judge.</p>
<p>The <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0707-lohan-20100707,0,3396101.story">Times article</a>&#0160;quoted Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Marsha N. Revel saying she’d pretty much had enough from Lohan. &quot;There were a number of instances of [Lohan] not taking things seriously,&quot; Revel said. &quot;It&#39;s like someone who cheats but doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s cheating if they don&#39;t get caught.&quot;<br /><br />Lohan&#39;s long list of transgressions includes missing court hearings, offering dubious explanations for her absences and failing to fulfill her duties outside the courtroom. </p>
<p>Celebrities have ample reasons to expect leniency in the entertainment capital of the world. Juries have proved unusually sympathetic to celebrity defendants, with O.J. Simpson being Exhibit A. Prosecutors have pulled their punches too -- for example, see <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/05/polanski-claims-prosecutors-using-false-information-in-extradition-fight.html">the deal</a> that Roman Polanski was offered before he fled the country. </p>
<p>But the pendulum swings both ways. Some judges and prosecutors have been accused of coming down especially hard on star defendants to demonstrate that they don&#39;t play favorites. Witness Paris Hilton being sent to jail for 45 days in 2007 for violating probation on a reckless driving conviction. Luckily for Hilton, Sheriff Lee Baca thought the jail term was excessive; he released her five days later. As a <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/09/us/09hilton.html">New York Times article</a>&#0160;put it, &quot;Ms. Hilton, for all her money and celebrity, seems to have been caught between battling arms of the justice system here, with prosecutors and Judge [Michael T.] Sauer determined to make a point by incarcerating her, only to have the sheriff’s office let her go.&quot;</p>Some believe Revel went over the top with Lohan. Opined the blog <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.opposingviews.com/i/does-lindsay-lohan-really-deserve-jail-time">Opposing Views</a>, &quot;It is not the law’s or society’s business to interfere with Lohan’s alcohol or drug habits – leave the kid alone – her legal problems stem from impaired driving so simply suspending her right to drive eliminates the problem without making a big deal out of what is not our business.&quot; 
<p>I disagree. That presumes the only way a drug addict or alcoholic could cause problems is in a car. And it ignores the fact that Lohan had a blatant disregard for the law.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, I believe that in Lohan&#39;s case, celebrity justice took a backseat to criminal justice. For the three years since her arrest in 2007, Lohan has broken the law repeatedly, ignored court orders and evinced no improvement in her addictions. Why is it unreasonable to sentence her to three months in jail and three months in rehab?<br /><br />Those of you who think the justice system has done wrong by Lindsay, take heart. According to The Times piece, she’s not likely to&#0160;serve her entire sentence because of &quot;severe jail overcrowding.&quot; Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s spokesman Steve Whitmore said most female offenders serve less than a quarter of their sentences with good behavior.<br /><br />Now, if Lohan can just manage the good behavior.</p>

The report also defends the actions of East Anglia University administrators, and says the work there didn&#39;t weaken the global warming evaluation made by the embattled Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
<p>Will the new report shore up support for climate legislation in Washington? Not likely -- Climategate was the kind of political scandal (doctored evidence! cover-up! conspiracy!) that&#39;s just too sexy to be beaten with white papers. But it&#39;s worth noting how tall the pile of white papers is growing -- <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2010/04/climategate-inquiry-clears-professors.html">two previous inquiries</a> also absolved the university and its scientists, and a Penn State University probe similarly <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://live.psu.edu/fullimg/userpics/10026/Final_Investigation_Report.pdf">cleared a scientist there</a> of suppressing or falsifying data.&#0160; </p>
<p>In <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.cce-review.org/pdf/MR%20Launch%20intro.pdf">summarizing the latest report</a>, the panel&#39;s leader -- Sir Muir Russell, a former academic and high-ranking government official in Scotland -- blistered the researchers for &quot;a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness&quot; that risked the reputation of climate science in the United Kingdom. But he also said:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Climate science is a matter of such global importance, that the highest standards of honesty, rigour and openness are needed in its conduct. On the specific allegations made against the behaviour of CRU scientists, we find that their rigour and honesty as scientists are not in doubt.<br /><br />In addition, we do not find that their behaviour has prejudiced the balance of advice given to policymakers. In particular, we did not find any evidence of behaviour that might undermine the conclusions of the [United Nations IPCC assessments.</p>
<p>The debate will, of course, continue over whether climate is changing and, if so, how much humans have to do with it. But perhaps it can focus again on long-term climate trends and changes in the atmosphere, rather than a handful of researchers&#39; ethics.</p>

<p>Steele is a gaffe machine as well as a poor historian. Remember when he said that Republicans couldn&#39;t regain control of the House this year? Or his suggestion that he came in for extra criticism because he was black? And then there was the revelation that the party -- without Steele&#39;s knowledge -- treated donors to a $2,000 night out at what The Times decorously called a &quot;sex-themed Hollywood club.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, it&#39;s all an internal matter. But those on the outside who comment on the Republican Party&#39;s image must be wondering why Steele is in the spotlight at all. It&#39;s a sad commentary on the state of Republican leadership that a glorified fund-raiser is acknowledged by Republicans and Democrats alike as the leader of the GOP. (Quick: Name Steele&#39;s predecessor, or any other national party chairman.) What happened to John McCain or Mitch McConnell? </p>

<p><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://persevere.lineages.co.uk/2010/07/03/we-must-crush-the-taliban-and-al-qaeda-in-a-long-war-in-afghanistan/">Persevere: Leith Community Portal</a> pointed its readers to John Bolton&#39;s July 1 op-ed, &quot;<a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-bolton-afghanistan-20100701,0,3770105.story">We must crush the Taliban and Al Qaeda in a &#39;long war&#39; in Afghanistan</a>.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.bloggingsbyboz.com/2010/07/guatemala-on-edge-again-still.html" target="_blank">Bloggings by boz</a> gave a shout-out to our <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-guatemala-20100702,0,3673558.story">July 2 editorial</a>, &quot;Guatemala at risk,&quot; which urged the Obama administration to scrutinize Guatemala more carefully, as it is in an extremely precarious position politically. </p>
<p>A post on <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://attackmachine.com/blog/2010/07/03/todays-fine-band-of-radicals/" target="_blank">Attack Machine</a> disagreed with Doyle McManus&#39; choice to use President Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s progressivism in his <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-mcmanus-kagan-20100701,0,3132044.column" target="_blank">July 1 op-ed</a> as a counter to Sen. Jeff Sessions&#39; (R-Ala.) argument that Elena Kagan&#39;s progressivism isn&#39;t conducive to her being a successful Supreme Court justice. Attack Point went on to say that &quot;progressives&quot; a century ago held much different values than the &quot;progressives&quot; of today, making a comparison like McManus&#39; obsolete.</p>
<p><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2010/07/04/the_rules_of_th.html" target="_blank">Advice Goddess Blog</a> mentioned Michael Shermer&#39;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-0702-shermer-doping-20100702,0,6758218,print.story" target="_blank">July 2 op-ed</a> on the application of game theory as a means of understanding why doping among cyclists is so widespread.</p>
<p>The New York Times included our <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-kagan-20100703,0,2541056.story" target="_blank">July 3 editorial</a> on Kagan in a roundup of opinions on her nomination that accompanied a <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/mcconnell-opposes-kagan/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Republican opposition.</p>
<p>Finally, conservative blogger Randall Smith at <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://perlstalker.blogspot.com/2010/07/meanings-dont-change-over-time.html">Perlstalker&#39;s Ramblings</a> found our <a href="/web/20100726121351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-declaration-20100704,0,1284401.story" target="_blank">July 4 editorial</a> &quot;troubling&quot; because it portrays the Constitution as a changing document; he sees it rather as a finite document whose original meanings remain intact regardless of the passage of time.</p>
