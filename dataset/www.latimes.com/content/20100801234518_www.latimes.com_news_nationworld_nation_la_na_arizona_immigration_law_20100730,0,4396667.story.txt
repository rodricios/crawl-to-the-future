Why do the people arguing for the illegal immigrants argue against the treatment these peopleÂ receive in their home countries? Why do they leave their home countries and come to this country? Why can they not earn a living in their own countries? Why do they not work in their home countries? What is it about their home countries that they find so distressing that they flee and come to America?

The type of government that they have in South American countries is so bad that the people of those countries flee and come here. Mexico is the home of Vanilla. Yes, that is right. Vanilla, the spice is from Mexico originally. Currently Mexico has 5% of the Vanilla market. Madagascar imported the Vanilla bean plant and now supplies 95% of the worlds Vanilla. Did anyone from Mexico ask why that happened? It is important. Because if you can't answer that question, you will continue to flee the impoverished country that is Mexico. Of course you do so as absolute cowards. You would rather flee than do the hard work of fixing your own country. You can scream at us because of your cowardice because we have laws protecting you. But your own government, they scare you and you are too weak of heart to respond. You take the cowards way out and come to the US. If Mexico is great, and I am saying it is a complete failure, how come you flee your country to ours?
