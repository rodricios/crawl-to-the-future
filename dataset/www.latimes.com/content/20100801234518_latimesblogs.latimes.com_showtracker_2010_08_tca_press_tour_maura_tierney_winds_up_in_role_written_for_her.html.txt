 Maura Tierney was not supposed to be in ABC's new legal drama "The Whole Truth."

Executive producer Tom Donaghy had written a lead role on the series for Tierney, who is a longtime friend. But the role went to Joely Richardson ("Nip/Tuck"), while Tierney, who was recovering after being diagnosed with breast cancer, had departed from the cast of "Parenthood."

But when Richardson had to deal with personal issues that prompted her exit from the series, Tierney, who was getting better, was hoping to get back to work.

"It was joint events happening at the same time," said executive producer Jonathan Littman. "Joely's life is very complicated, and the timing just worked out for Maura."

Tierney, who has appeared in several series including "ER" and "NewsRadio," was not particularly forthcoming when talking about her return to work following her health scare.

When asked if she had a renewed perspective on life, she replied, "I probably should have more of a perspective than I have. But it's wonderful to know that people care so much." She did add that she had one new priority: "It's a priority to work with people I like and trust. Tom and I haveÂ been friends for more than 20 years."
