	  		Bluetooth: Next Big Wave in Electronics? 
	  		

			
	  		
	  		Companies Scramble to Use the Radio Technology to Link Computers, Gadgets

	  		     In the white-hot quest for the next big thing in personal
electronics, the word on the lips of technology executives these days is
"Bluetooth."
     This soon-to-be-introduced wireless technology uses simple shortwave
radio links to allow devices such as laptop computers, cell phones,
personal digital assistants such as Palm, cameras and printers to
communicate with one another over short distances.
     As all these devices have surged in popularity, the tangled webs of
wires and cables around desks have become an increasing frustration for
consumers and manufacturers. Bluetooth has the potential to make most of
those wires disappear, and with its promise of low-cost and nearly
universal compatibility, big-name consumer electronics and chip makers
are clambering aboard.
     With Bluetooth radio connections, individuals will be able to form
their own personal networks, using as many as eight electronic devices
within about 33 feet of one another to exchange schedules and address
book information, compete at video games, print documents, trade business
cards or even access the Internet without plugging in.
     Industry giants such as Nokia Corp., Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc.,
Microsoft Corp., Ericsson Mobile Communications, Motorola Inc., IBM Corp.
and Toshiba Corp. are all readying Bluetooth devices.
     One of the first gadgets is a wireless headset by Ericsson that links
to a cell phone, expected to be ready for the holiday shopping season.
The headset has a Bluetooth chip, so it can communicate with an Ericsson
cell phone, enabling users to talk hands-free while driving or to walk
around the kitchen and slice a pizza while staying in touch.
     The other early products will be add-ons for existing devices, such as
Bluetooth attachments that can establish radio connections to computers,
hand-held data assistants and cell phones.
     Motorola, Intel and IBM will soon offer PC cards and port accessories
so that old laptops, printers and hand-held data assistants can have a
new Bluetooth link, enabling them to share files without plugging in. The
IBM PC card, expected by October, will cost under $200, the company said.
     "Early Bluetooth products are more expensive. They will come down in
price substantially over time," said Howard Dulany, marketing manager for
wireless products at IBM.
     IBM and Toshiba also plan to offer Bluetooth in upcoming computer
models. Some of IBM's ThinkPad laptop computers will come with built-in
Bluetooth technology by early next year.
     Already more than 1,600 companies are developing devices and
applications for Bluetooth, which was named for 10th century Danish King
Harald Bluetooth, best known for uniting Denmark with Norway.
     The Bluetooth communications standard is being promoted by a
consortium of firms, including Ericsson, Nokia, Intel, Toshiba and IBM.
To encourage its widespread adoption, it is available free to any company
that wants to try to develop products or software that utilize it. And
because Bluetooth operates in an unregulated part of the radio spectrum,
there are virtually no government authorities to reckon with.
     As with most new technologies, the value of Bluetooth will increase as
it becomes more widely used. By 2005, about 1.4 billion Bluetooth
products will be shipped, predicts market research firm Cahners In-Stat
Group.
     "It's a great concept, and everyone in the wireless industry is
waiting . . . to find it in commercial products," said Alan Reiter of
consulting firm Wireless Internet & Mobile Computing in Chevy Chase, Md.
"But technologists are often overly optimistic about how fast they can
create products. If you want inter-operability, you have to get everyone
in the room to agree" to use it.
     Southland Firms Buy Into Technology
     Still, the potential demand for Bluetooth devices has spurred Southern
California companies to pay top dollar for entree into the Bluetooth
market.
     Chip maker Conexant Systems Inc. of Newport Beach paid about $117
million in April for Bluetooth developer Philsar Semiconductor Inc. of
Ontario, Canada. And rival Broadcom Corp. quickly followed suit. In May
and June, the Irvine maker of high-speed communications chips paid more
than $1 billion for two companies, Pivotal Technologies Corp. of Pasadena
and Innovent Systems Inc. of El Segundo, which develop Bluetooth
semiconductors and software.
     "Bluetooth cuts across a number of different market segments that are
going to be increasingly important to people," said Broadcom Chief
Executive Henry Nicholas III. "We see it as an extremely important means
of distributing broadband throughout the home."
     After Broadcom's second deal was announced, Nicholas boasted that
Broadcom now had the largest engineering work force dedicated to
Bluetooth in the world, nearly 100 people in all.
     But it's a tiny British start-up with 15 engineers, Cambridge Silicon
Radio, that analysts say has captured the lead in bringing the simplest,
low-cost Bluetooth chip to market. The company, in which Intel is an
investor, is the first to offer Bluetooth on a single silicon chip,
although Broadcom says it is fast on its way to delivering a similar
solution.
     Conexant, on the other hand, is dealing in Bluetooth chips that use
more expensive technology but consume less power--an important concern in
battery-operated devices that can quickly run out of juice.
     Bluetooth enthusiasts envision within a few years that the technology
will be so commonplace that consumers could walk their laptop by an
Internet terminal at the airport and beam their e-mail to the office
between flights. Or aim their Palm or mobile phone at a vending machine
and charge a soda to a credit card without fishing for cash; flirt with
someone at the grocery store by launching a telephone number straight
into his or her cell phone; shoot photos with a Bluetooth-enabled digital
camera and e-mail the pictures directly to their grandma via a laptop. Or
drive a car on any toll road in the country, and with a Bluetooth chip
embedded in the car, there will be no need to stop to pay tolls; the bill
will simply show up on a credit card statement.
     As for security concerns, different levels of protection will be
available for Bluetooth communications, from simple passwords to
sophisticated encryption software. Each Bluetooth device will have a
unique address, so material won't be sent inadvertently to the wrong
recipient. And Bluetooth signals change frequency 1,600 times a second,
making them difficult to intercept.
     Current Bluetooth applications are capable of moving data at about 723
kilobits per second, more than 10 times the speed of the fastest
telephone modem but not as fast as digital subscriber lines and
high-speed cable modems. Those speeds are expected to improve over time.
     Analysts Say Cost Is Key
     Of course, other wireless technologies are already on the market, and
some are able to carry considerably more data over much greater distances
than 33 feet.
     But the key to Bluetooth, analysts say, will be its low cost. Within
the next few years, Bluetooth chips are expected to wholesale for $5 a
piece, which will make the technology feasible for a wide range of
applications. In these early days, though, the chips are going for more
than twice that price.
     Yet even as companies scramble to take a bite out of this emerging
market, some experts believe that the industry's appetite for Bluetooth
is overblown.
     "The technology can't be everything it's hyped up to be. The
expectations are all out of proportion," said Thomas Lee, an engineering
professor at Stanford University who specializes in wireless technology.
     Not until prices are low enough that people start putting the
technology into "foolish things" will its promise be realized--somewhere
between 50 cents and a dollar a chip, Lee said.
     Another possible hang-up is the potential for wireless mischief that
Bluetooth presents. Lee says he's not so worried that personal
information will be stolen; that can be safeguarded with software and
encryption technologies. The problem, he says, is that a high school tech
geek will be able to figure out how to jam all the Bluetooth signals
within range, bringing the wireless love-in to a frustrating halt.
     "Wireless links are much more susceptible to that kind of mischief"
than the wired world, Lee said.
