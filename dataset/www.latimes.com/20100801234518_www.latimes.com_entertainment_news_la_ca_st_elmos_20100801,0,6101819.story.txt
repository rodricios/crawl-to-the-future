Uh, when does the article begin? This blurb is a prime example of why Blogs always seem amateurish and unprofessional. There is simply no information in the article which informs the header of this article. Also, who ever edited this piece should go back to his day job. Clearly, the piece was not reviewed for its lack of content. This reflects very poorly on the Tribune management of a once great paper. Such an incomplete piece would never have appeared under the Chandler family.
