KTLA's Kit Clarifies Grey Report







KTLA-TV Channel 5 entertainment reporter Zorianna Kit late Tuesday acknowledged that she did not tell viewers that her husband was once involved in a lawsuit with Brad Grey when she aired a critical report in January about Grey's hiring as Paramount Pictures' new chief.
 The on-air statement came after The Times reported Tuesday that Kit failed to disclose to viewers that her husband, writer-producer Bo Zenga, had lost a lawsuit he had filed against Grey over profit from the hit film "Scary Movie." Zenga and Grey were executive producers of the comedy. 

 
 














 
 

 
 



 In reporting on Grey's hiring, Kit called his film credentials "extremely limited," noted that he produced the flop "View From the Top" and ended with the comments, "Hmm, good luck, Paramount."
 In what she termed a clarification, Kit said her report about Grey was "no different than what appeared in a number of other trade publications and the Los Angeles Times. Now I did not make the disclosure of a personal connection during my Jan. 6 report, and I want to make it clear now."
