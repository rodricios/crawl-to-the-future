The #1 thing keeping my people (Mexicans, Central Americans, Native Americans) down is Christianity and its institutions.

So-called "Christians" exterminated 95% of all Indigenous People in the Western Hemisphere (how Christian of them!), starting with Columbus, Cortes, Pizarro, de Soto, etc.

These Vampire Churches keep preying on us today, stealing our thoughts, our money, and our ability to get off our knees. They rape our children and our minds.

I applaud all those who seek to neutralize the Christian Mafia. The time has come to be free from this.
