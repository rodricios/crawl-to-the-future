Sandra Bullock doesn't want to be "the one" anymore.

The actress and new mom made headlines Friday by asking that her image be removed from a recent celebrity PSA promoting restoration of the Gulf Coast. 

Did she stumble into some bad lighting? No. Is the organization responsible for the PSA in bed with major oil companies? Well ...

What we know: Women of the Storm, billed as a nonpartisan collection of women assisting relief efforts in the wake of the BP oil-spill disaster, counts the America's Wetlands Foundation as a partner. The America's Wetlands group lists BP as a sponsor (along with many others).

"Ms. Bullock was originally contacted through her attorney to be a part of the PSA in order to promote awareness of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico," a rep for Bullock said.

"At no time was she made aware that any organization, oil company or otherwise had influence over Women of the Storm or its message. We have immediately asked for her participation in the PSA be removed until the facts can be determined."

A spokeswoman for Women of the Storm told People magazine that no money from BP or other oil sponsors was used to produce the celeb spot, which also includes Blake Lively and Lenny Kravitz.

Is Bullock making the right choice, or making something out of nothing? Tell us in the comments section below.
