After years of painstaking studies, millions of dollars and one
failed federal application for nighttime flight restrictions, Bob Hope
Airport officials are turning to Congress.

Three representatives whose districts are most affected
by curfews signed a letter seeking legislation to bar flights from
arriving or departing between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. at Bob Hope and Van
Nuys airports.

The effort comes one year after the Federal Aviation Administration
rejected the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority's request to
impose a ban in what has become a decades-long effort to dampen aircraft noise.

Commercial airlines have agreed to a voluntary curfew at Bob Hope
Airport, but freight carriers and others oppose a curfew they say would
hurt business.
