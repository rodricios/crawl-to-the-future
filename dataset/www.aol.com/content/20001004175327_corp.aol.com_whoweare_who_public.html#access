<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="3" color="#003366">Exploring
Internet Public Policy</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Every day, thousands of
people &quot;go online&quot; for the first time to explore the exciting new
medium known as the Internet. At America Online we believe this interactive
medium is fundamentally changing the way citizens communicate and educate
themselves—and the way consumers buy goods and services—both in this country
and around the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">But the development of this
dynamic new environment has only just begun. There is still a world of exciting
possibilities ahead, and as the Internet continues to grow, we at AOL want to
play our part in ensuring that it grows successfully, efficiently, and
fairly—into a medium that we can all be proud of. That’s why the AOL
corporate mission is to build a global medium as central to people’s lives as
the telephone or television—and even more valuable.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Public Policy Principles</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">America Online believes,
therefore, that a few basic principles should guide the development of a public
policy environment designed to make the Internet accessible, affordable and
valuable to all members of the global community. We believe that adherence to
these principles will deliver the economic and social benefits promised by this
new Internet medium.</font>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Internet policy should
    foster individual choice and empowerment in the economic and social
    dimensions and rely on individual decision-making for determining the
    products, services and content available on the Internet. Practices
    developed in the crucible of the private sector and the marketplace can best
    direct the development of the interactive medium.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Public policies should be
    market-driven and industry-led. Policies should be developed
    collaboratively, with input from industry leaders, government officials and,
    perhaps most importantly, consumers and other stakeholders. Public or
    private gatekeepers should not be allowed to prevent new entry, deny
    business opportunities or limit the free flow of information in the
    Internet.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Where government
    involvement is determined to be necessary, policies should be
    technologically neutral and non-discriminatory, to ensure that the Internet
    enjoys the same potential for growth as any other medium and that the value
    of the unique, interactive nature of this new medium can be fully realized.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Policies should be
    designed to assure that all segments of society and all countries of the
    world have access to the potential economic and social benefits of this new
    medium—and that the medium becomes as essential to our daily lives as the
    television and the telephone, and more valuable.</font>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">In sum, we seek to maximize
the economic and social benefits of the Internet with industry-led,
market-driven policies that allow this dynamic medium to reach its full
potential.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">&quot;It is more important
than ever that policymakers, both in the U.S. and abroad, recognize the enormous
potential economic and social benefits of the medium.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Back

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Internet’s Astounding
Growth</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">In the few short years since
it became a part of people’s everyday lives, the Internet has managed to link
communities together in an unparalleled fashion. The medium’s growth rate has
been nothing less than phenomenal. In 1990 only a small cadre of researchers
knew what the Internet was. By mid-1999, worldwide, 150 million individuals were
connected to the Internet. Some estimates suggest that worldwide there soon will
be as many as one billion people online.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Closer to home, more than 50
million American households and millions of businesses, schools, libraries and
other institutions have access to the Internet, and that number is growing
rapidly. Network traffic continues to double every 100 days, and Jupiter
Communications, a leading Internet analyst firm, projects that almost 55 percent
of the U.S. population will be online by 2002. According to a Roper Starch study
that AOL recently commissioned, nearly two-thirds of Internet consumers who have
been online three or more years now view the interactive medium as a necessity
in their lives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Internet today has been
compared to the telephone in the 1920s or television in the 1950s. And yet,
while it took the mass market almost three decades to adopt the phone and TV,
the Internet has been adopted on a mass scale within just five years. Why?
Perhaps because, unlike radio and television, the Internet is open, interactive
and decentralized. Any one user, anywhere in the world, can &quot;publish&quot;
and distribute information or electronic products and services to a virtually
unlimited Internet audience, at very little cost. In fact, most of the content
on the Internet is user-generated. These key factors—openness, interactivity
and decentralization—make the Internet a uniquely empowering medium that can
have a dramatic impact on people’s lives.</font></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Back
to top</font></a>
<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Fueling the Economy</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Because of its unique
structure, the Internet is bringing a new dynamic to the world economy. In fact,
the low cost of opening an Internet &quot;store&quot; and of marketing and
distributing goods and services is bringing more products and services to more
people at lower costs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Key technology—and even
non-technology—companies and innovators will see large percentages of their
business move online. Automotive industry analyst J.D. Power estimates that half
of all auto sales will soon involve the Internet. Banking, advertising, real
estate, insurance—all of these industries, and many more, now take advantage
of the immediacy, interactivity and convenience offered by the Internet and
online services, which provide new ways of reaching customers at a fraction of
the costs of traditional media.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">By 2002, according to U.S.
Commerce Department figures, $300 billion worth of business-to-business commerce
will be conducted online. And it’s not just big companies that are reaping the
benefits of this new medium. More than half of all small businesses in the
United States are now online. Analysts project that more than 500,000 small
companies will be engaged in business-to-business electronic commerce by 2002.
Small business is the lifeblood of any community, and when it prospers, the
whole community prospers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The information technology
industry represents more than one-third of the real economic growth in the
United States over the last five years. It generates more than 8% of the U.S.
gross domestic product and more than 7 million jobs paying significantly above
the private sector average. By 2006, the Commerce Department projects, almost
half of U.S. workers will be employed by industries that produce information
technology or are intensive users of it. These figures mean renewed strength for
the economy and exciting new business opportunities for a great number of
people.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A Consumer Revolution</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><b>Online commerce is also
becoming nothing short of an economic revolution for consumers.</b><br>
Like everything else in this medium that seems to move at lightning speed,
online commerce is gaining acceptance and momentum within the mass market at a
breakneck pace. U.S. consumers purchased almost $13.6 billion in goods and
services online in 1998, including $3.5 billion generated during the holiday
shopping season alone ($1.2 billion of which can be attributed to AOL members!).
E-commerce is expected to grow to $3.2 trillion worldwide by 2003, according to
Forrester Research. By the end of 1998, 35% of the Internet population had made
an online purchase, and 26% of the total family holiday buying in 1998 was
conducted over the Internet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Even the most powerful brands
are experiencing a tremendous shift in power in favor of the consumer. In fact,
the Internet is helping to usher in a new business era in which the
well-informed consumer rules the marketplace. We believe there are three
important principles that govern this highly consumer-centric era—principles
that will ultimately change the face of business.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><b>Better-informed buyers
expect more value for their money</b><br>
More than ever, consumers are seeking value. For some, this might mean lower
prices; for others it’s convenience, product quality, excellent service, or
some combination. The Internet provides consumers with all the information they
need to comparison shop until they find what they regard as the best value. If
their traditional brand doesn’t give it to them, they’ll find someone else
who does.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><b>Consumers expect more
control</b><br>
Online consumers are active, not passive. They search the Web for the
information they need to make their buying decisions, they read reviews and
information bulletin boards, and they share insights with others in online
communities. The more these customers learn, the more control they demand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><b>Consumers place a high
premium on convenience</b><br>
Nothing is as precious as time, and consumers have ever less of it to spend.
Computers are among the most powerful laborsaving devices ever invented, and the
Internet has expanded that convenience by orders of magnitude. E-commerce offers
customers the triple pleasures of speed, convenience and efficiency. They can
buy what they want, when they want it, without leaving the comfort of their
homes. There are no closing hours, no holidays, no battles for a parking spot in
cyberspace. They can check their bank statement, pay their bills, or buy their
spouse an anniversary gift in the middle of the night, if necessary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Consumers are migrating to
the interactive medium to meet their commerce needs because it is convenient and
fast, and offers an ever-growing selection of goods and services. Already,
consumers can get an auto loan approved on the Internet in less than 15 seconds,
make airline reservations for a flight around the world with the click of a
mouse, and buy gifts for an entire family online in the time it takes for dinner
to cook.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">And that’s only what
consumers can do online today. Within less than a decade, technology experts
predict that consumers will be able to do such amazing things as:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">place a person-to-person
    call overseas without having to know how to speak a foreign
    language—because the computer will automatically translate;</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">buy music online directly
    from the artist or company that created it and download it directly to his
    or her own computer; or</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">download newspapers,
    brochures and books of all kinds straight from the Internet to palm-sized
    &quot;electronic books.&quot;</font>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Consumers’ confidence about
the safety of online transactions is also steadily increasing. Secure
technologies within the international marketplace, as well as the 100 percent
Total Satisfaction Guarantee we offer at AOL, have gone a long way to allay
consumer worries about the security of online commerce. In 1997, for example,
10% of U.S. consumers did their holiday shopping online—and during the 1998
holiday season AOL members spent $1.2 billion shopping online. In fact,
according to ZONA research, on average, 26% of the total family holiday buying
in 1998 was done over the Internet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">With today’s technology,
we’ve been able to change the methods and economics of retailing, as well as
offer new levels of security and protection to increase consumer confidence
online. And we are starting to see online products and services that are
superior in many respects to their offline counterparts—offering greater
selection, better information, lower prices or different features. In fact,
according to the Roper Starch study, of those who shop online regularly, almost
half (47%) conduct online research as a first step before making a major
purchase.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Longer term, we believe the
benefits of transacting online will stimulate a consumer behavior shift away
from bricks-and-mortar stores, paper checks and bills, and written signatures.
Recent one-hour promotions on the AOL service, for example, attracted more than
50,000 members to the Preview Travel site for $99 airfares and more than 30,000
to the Music Boulevard site for the Titanic soundtrack. It’s hard to imagine a
bricks-and-mortar store accommodating the crush of 30,000 to 50,000 customers in
one hour.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">In short, we believe the
Internet is ushering in a world of digital information and personalization that
has the capability to change how we exchange funds, contract for services, and
purchase or sell products.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">&quot;Consumers are migrating
to the interactive medium to meet their commerce needs because it is convenient
and fast, and offers an ever-growing selection of goods and services.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Back

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Improving Our Community</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Of course, technology is most
valuable when it improves the lives of the people who use it. The Internet has
made some remarkable contributions to society already, but there is much more
that can be done.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">&quot;Resources available
online can enrich a student’s learning experience by opening doors to vast
amounts of information, unique perspectives, and creative methods for
teaching.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Back
to top</font></a>
<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Enriching Education</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Internet has
extraordinary potential as an educational tool. Resources available online can
enrich a student’s learning experience by opening doors to vast amounts of
information, unique perspectives, and creative methods for teaching. By 1998,
more than 85% of all schools in the United States had Internet access, compared
to 32% in 1996. But &quot;access&quot; doesn’t necessarily mean that students
actually have the capability to get online; unfortunately, only a relatively
small percentage of students are being exposed to a curriculum that effectively
integrates the Internet’s full capacity. As technology becomes more and more
essential to our society, we must therefore work to ensure that online resources
are widely available in the classroom, and that teachers receive training in how
to use these technologies to their maximum potential.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">We at AOL hope to play a part
in this exciting new world of educational opportunity. Through our partnership
with the Family Education Network, every school in the country has the
opportunity to have its own free personalized Web site devoted to enhancing
communications between parents, teachers and administrators. We offer free AOL
accounts to schools in Empowerment Zones. In partnership with the National
School Boards Association we are distributing free child-safety videos to
schools and libraries across the country. And with the American Library
Association we have set up Internet clinics for kids and parents or teachers,
including hands-on surfing, in numerous cities across the country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">In addition, the AOL
Foundation, created in 1997, is seeding scores of pilot projects across the
country to enable teams of teachers and community leaders to test innovative
uses of technology in education. Our hope is to use these pilot projects to
develop best practices that can then be made available broadly to help other
teachers and communities. We have also implemented a number of other education
initiatives—with such goals as increasing parental involvement in education
and promoting child safety online—and look forward to continuing to work with
our industry colleagues, along with lawmakers and community partners, to make
technology and education a high priority.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Fostering Democratization</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Internet is playing a
major role in revitalizing civic discourse and encouraging more citizen
involvement in the political process. During the 1998 elections, 16% of U.S.
voters generally—and an amazing 28% of voters aged 18-29—got the information
they needed about candidates and campaigns from the Internet, according to the
Pew Research Center for People and Media. This represents a 60% increase over
1996, when only 10% of voters went online for election information. Many of
those voters were also newcomers to the online world. In a survey by &quot;Web
White &amp; Blue,&quot; a political-awareness Web site sponsored during the 1998
elections by the Markle Foundation and Harvard University’s Shorenstein
Center, with Web hosting services by AOL, 84% of the site users said that this
was the first time they used the Internet to find election information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">&quot;My Government,&quot; a
new AOL area that gives AOL members the latest news about the White House,
federal agencies, Congress, the Supreme Court and election campaigns, has become
one of the most popular areas on the service. We believe that the Internet
medium has tremendous potential for providing all citizens with tools for making
themselves heard on issues at the local, state and national government levels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">We are also dedicated to
using the immediacy and interactivity of this medium to achieve a higher level
of civic discourse and open meaningful dialogues between citizens and their
elected or appointed representatives. Ultimately, we believe that many
government services will be provided online, and we are already working on pilot
programs at several levels to test the right way to build such programs.</font></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Back

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Bringing Healthcare Close to
Home</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Internet is having a
major impact on the awareness and availability of health care treatments,
products and services. Online access to medical journals, support groups and
interactive Web sites maintained by leading hospitals has made the Internet a
source of medical information for millions of Americans. An estimated one-third
of all Internet users now seek out health information online, and we expect that
critical health and medical information will become even more widely available
in the near future. Furthermore, doctors and medical personnel are expanding
their abilities to treat rural communities through &quot;tele-medicine,&quot; or
long-distance, Internet-based access to leading medical practitioners and
resources.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">At AOL and through the AOL
Foundation we are exploring how best to harness the power of the medium to
ensure that health information and services become widely available to all
people regardless of geographic or economic disadvantages‚ as well as actually
improving the quality and consistency of health care services while controlling
costs.</font></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Back
to top</font></a>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><b><a name="access"></a>Making
the Internet Accessible to People with Disabilities<br>
</b><br>
At America Online, we believe that the Internet and AOL should be friendly and
easy-to-use for all consumers, including those with disabilities. In that
spirit, we have developed the America Online <a href="../access_policy.html">Accessibility
Policy</a> which expresses our commitment to the development of products and
services that are accessible to all users.<br>
<br>
When the challenges confronted by people with disabilities are known, solutions
can be incorporated in the research and design of information technologies. So
we have taken steps to ensure that our employees are informed about the
challenges faced by people with disabilities and aware of the technologies
available to improve the user experience. We have also worked closely with
people from the disability community whose input and feedback is essential to
helping us design products and services that meet the needs of our users.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Bridging the Digital Divide</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">As the online world continues
to expand, embracing more people around the globe and becoming an indispensable
part of their daily lives, it is important to ensure that we put the empowering
educational, economic, consumer and social benefits of this technology within
the reach of those with the greatest needs. Unfortunately, the divide between
the haves and have-nots seems to grow wider each year. Our new medium holds
enormous potential to narrow that gap — by empowering individuals and cutting
across geographic, ethnic, economic and cultural boundaries to strengthen
communities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Internet is helping to
strengthen communities by overcoming the twin barriers of distance and
economics. But in some places the &quot;digital divide&quot; between those who
use computers and those who do not is widening. A recent Vanderbilt University
study found that African-American families with annual incomes of $40,000 and up
are rapidly closing the gap that once existed between themselves and white
families in terms of PC ownership and online access—but that for
African-American households making less than $40,000 a year the gap is widening.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">AOL and the AOL Foundation
have begun to address the problem of the &quot;digital divide&quot; through
several research initiatives, partnerships and projects. We believe strongly
that the medium cannot reach its potential without a strong focus by industry,
the policy community and the non-profit community working together. There is
much more to be done to ensure that all Americans, no matter what their
backgrounds, can share in the economic and social benefits of the Internet. We
believe that widespread use of the medium can be used to expand entrepreneurial
opportunities in communities that lack access to capital, foster greater
understanding and tolerance of religious and cultural differences, and provide
rural citizens with greater access to information, goods and services. And
that’s only the beginning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">&quot;The Internet is playing
a major role in revitalizing civic discourse and encouraging more citizen
involvement in the political process.&quot;</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The Public Policy
Environment</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Policymakers in the United
States and other countries are spending increasing amounts of time on Internet
policy, trying to determine the right approach to the public policy issues
facing this explosive new medium. In the session of the U.S. Congress that ended
in 1994, there were only seven bills related to the Internet. Four years later,
the 105th Congress considered almost 200 bills relating to the Internet. And the
106th Congress is more active on these issues than ever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Other countries are also
beginning to devote significant attention to Internet policy issues. And because
this medium is inherently global, policy decisions overseas can have a
significant impact on e-commerce in the United States. Therefore, it is more
important than ever that policymakers, both in the U.S. and abroad, recognize
the enormous potential economic and social benefits of the medium—and not
unintentionally stifle its growth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Over the last several years,
each new session of Congress has expanded the digital agenda to include various</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">e-commerce and consumer
issues. The 106th Congress is now examining such issues as Internet privacy and
security, the importance of open access and consumer choice to new broadband
distribution systems, the role of federal antitrust laws in fostering
competition in the Internet industry, the privatization of the Internet address
system, and a wide range of content and consumer protection questions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">As the Internet becomes
increasingly integrated into our societal fabric, it is crucial to strike an
appropriate balance between the role of the government and the role of industry
in formulating solutions to Internet policy issues. Finding this balance is the
key to ensuring that the Internet will continue to grow to reach its full
potential, unhampered by unnecessary regulation but appropriately guided and
monitored in crucial areas to protect the safety and security of its users.</font></p>
