Bush, Gore briefs on ballot recounts due at Florida Supreme Court

TALLAHASSEE, Florida (CNN) -- Attorneys for Al Gore and George W. Bush have until 3 p.m. Tuesday to submit briefs to the Florida Supreme Court, which is under order from the United States Supreme Court to clarify its ballot recount decision that favored Gore.

The Florida high court's ruling extended a state deadline for certifying the election results by 12 days until November 26 so that manual recount results could be added to the state's final tally. The Florida court must now explain to the nation's highest court if it based that extension decision on Florida's law or the state constitution.

After the recounts allowed under the Florida Supreme Court ruling, Bush was certified the state victor by 537 votes. Bush wants to reinstate his original 930-vote lead over the vice president under the original November 14 deadline.

The Florida Legislature filed a notice with the state high court, reiterating its position that it had the authority to settle election disputes and asking that it be allowed to file a friend-of-the-court brief. Craig Waters, a spokesman for the court, said no decision had been made on possible oral arguments.

Gore's attorneys have also appealed to the Florida Supreme Court to overturn a Leon County Circuit Court decision Monday that rejected Gore's contest of Bush's certified victory.

Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls ruled that Gore's legal team failed to meet the legal burden in their case. Part of that burden was proving that Gore rather than Bush would have been declared the winner if ballots in two counties were manually recounted. (More on Sauls' ruling)

Sauls also said the court found no "illegality, dishonesty, gross negligence, improper influence, coercion or fraud in the balloting and counting processes." 

Gore had sought a hand recount of some 14,000 disputed ballots from South Florida. Bush's battery of lawyers said the Florida Legislature made no provisions for manual recounts, especially since there has been no allegation of voting equipment failure. Also involved in the case were lawyers for voters and for Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who has declared Bush the winner.

Other court action scheduled on Tuesday

 The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, will hear oral arguments Tuesday in cases brought before it by Bush supporters arguing that the hand counts in only a few counties violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution because that would mean not all votes in the state are treated alike.

The claim has already lost at the U.S. District Court level. If the Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with the lower court, the Bush camp could appeal that to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices may accept or deny it, but they are less inclined to hear a case that has lost twice in lower courts and for which there is no conflicting Circuit Court ruling.

 A federal judge in Pensacola, Florida, will hear arguments Tuesday morning during a hearing on a Republican request for a declaratory judgment on whether disqualified overseas ballots, most of them military, should be counted. The Republicans filed the lawsuit in both federal and circuit courts to force counties to include the overseas ballots to increase Bush's margin of victory.

 The Florida Supreme Court received briefs Monday from a Florida voter, Matt Butler, a resident of Collier County, who is challenging the manual recounts as unconstitutional. Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth filed a reply, saying that Butler lacked any standing in the matter and the case should be dismissed.

 After the two setbacks in two courts on Monday, Republicans increased their calls for Gore to concede. But his legal team said the Florida Supreme Court would have the final say. 

"I think whoever wins in the Florida Supreme Court will accept that," said attorney David Boies. "We have certainly said from the beginning that we accept the rule of law, that when the Florida Supreme Court makes its decision on this matter, we will accept that."

 House and Senate Democratic leaders Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle rushed Monday to support Gore's appeal of the circuit court decision, but several party sources said privately the vice president was running short of time -- and legal options.

"While the courts go about their important work, we remain committed to a full, fair and accurate count in Florida.  There is still enough time to count all the votes," said a statement released by the two top Democratic leaders.

But one Democratic lawmaker told CNN, "It is going to be much more difficult now to keep the already nervous people from speaking out, urging the vice president to bow out." (More on Democrat reaction)

 Earlier Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Florida Supreme Court to take another look at a vote recount decision that benefited Gore.  But Republicans say they're not celebrating. "We don't want to jump to any conclusions," a Bush campaign official told CNN.  (More on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling) | (Text of the ruling -- requires Adobe® Acrobat® Reader)

 The Florida Supreme Court will accept briefs from the two parties on the case until 3 p.m. Tuesday, Waters said. The court has not decided whether there will be oral arguments, he said.

The Florida high court decision extended a state deadline for certifying the election results by 12 days until November 26 so that hand-counted votes could be included in the final tally.

After the recounts allowed under the Florida Supreme Court ruling, Bush was certified the state victor. Bush wanted to reinstate his original 930-vote lead over the vice president under the original November 14 deadline.

 Bush, at the Texas governor's mansion in Austin, said Monday he was pleased with the U.S. Supreme Court decision.

"I think America ought to be comforted to know that the Supreme Court is going to make sure the outcome of this election is fair," Bush said.

"I'm grateful that the court made the decision that it made," Bush told reporters before the Leon County Circuit Court's decision rejecting Gore's call for a manual recount of disputed ballots was announced.

 James Baker III, point man for the Bush campaign in the Florida dispute, said the Republicans believe they won, and he added that any future action by the Florida court "will  be subject to U.S. Supreme Court review."

He declined to assess the precise effect of the ruling on the vote totals certified in Florida. "If there is a new total, it moves up, it doesn't move down, and we're ahead," Baker said. "From our standpoint, at least, it was a win."

But Gore's legal team does not view the U.S. Supreme Court decision as a blow to their side. "The Florida Supreme Court decision has not been reversed," Boies said, "it has been sent back to have them explain it."

 Monday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling did what Bush wanted, but only temporarily. The nation's highest court set aside -- but did not overturn -- the Florida Supreme Court decision. Justices said they found "considerable uncertainty" about the legal basis for the Florida ruling.  

Bush said he was grateful for the U.S. Supreme Court decision. But despite the fact that Bush believes he won the election, he said he was not prepared to say Gore should concede the presidential race.

Bush spoke to reporters at the governor's mansion in Austin, Texas, while meeting with Andrew Card, his choice for chief of staff.

 Bush's father, former President George Bush, 76, will undergo hip replacement surgery Tuesday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The clinic, which made the announcement on Monday, provided no details. (More on George Bush)

 A U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee heard testimony Monday on whether the federal law governing presidential transitions needs to be changed so that both candidates in a disputed election can prepare to assume the presidency. The General Services Administration refuses to release $5.3 million in transition funds to either Bush or Gore because it's still uncertain which candidate will be sworn in as president. Republicans on the panel believe the money should be given immediately to Bush, and that failure to do so could impede a smooth handover of power from the Clinton administration. For now, Bush's transition is being funded privately. (More on Congress)

 Gore is in Washington, where he met Monday with his transition team. He made no public statements on either of the rulings.

 Florida's Republican-majority  Legislature laid low Monday. After the Sauls' ruling, state Senate President John McKay said he was still considering convening a special session to name electors who would vote for Bush in the Electoral College, which meets December 18. McKay said he had reviewed the report of a special legislative panel that recommended such a move, but he wanted to deliberate the matter further in light of the latest court decision.

"I expect this process to require another day or two," McKay said. State House Speaker Tom Feeney, also a Republican, has already said that he wants a special session. Both men must call for the session if it is to be convened. (More on the Florida Legislature)

 A majority of Americans want disputed ballots in Florida counted by hand and the state's Legislature to stay out of the presidential election, a survey published Monday found. But the Washington Post-ABC News poll also found that 57 percent of those surveyed believe Gore should concede the election and let Bush assume the presidency.   

 Sen. John Breaux, D-Louisiana, said Monday on NBC's "Today" show that both candidates will have to find "an appropriate time" to conclude the election battle.  "The most important speech of this election is ... going to be given by the loser when they concede because it will set the tone for the next four years," he said. Breaux is among a number of Democrats whom Bush advisers have suggested for a slot in a Republican administration.          

 A trial will begin Wednesday in a case brought by a Democratic activist who is challenging absentee ballots cast in Seminole County. The suit, which is being heard in Leon County Circuit Court, seeks to throw out up to 15,000 absentee votes, most of them for Bush, on the grounds that Republicans were improperly allowed to fill in missing data on absentee ballot applications. 

 A similar suit was filed by a Democratic voter seeking to disqualify 9,800 absentee ballots cast in Republican-leaning Martin County, which would give the vice president a net gain of more than 2,800 votes.

 The would-be Bush-Cheney administration has set up a Web site that includes transition news and an application form for job seekers.  The address is http://www.bushcheneytransition.com/.A Bush aide said Sunday that campaign staffers are "still working out kinks" on the site.

Florida's 25 electoral votes are the balance that will determine who wins the presidential contest still in dispute nearly four weeks after the November 7 election which gave Gore a 337,576-vote lead in the vote nationwide.
