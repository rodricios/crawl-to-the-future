     evaluation of any specific information, opinion, advice or other content.



12.  Miscellaneous.  This Agreement and any operating rules for CNN Interactive

     established by CNN constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the

     subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between

     the parties with respect to such subject matter.  This Agreement shall be construed in

     accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict of laws

     rules.  No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed

     to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.  The section headings

     used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.

12.  Miscellaneous.  This Agreement and any operating rules for CNN Interactive

     established by CNN constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the

     subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between

     accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict of laws

     rules.  No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed
